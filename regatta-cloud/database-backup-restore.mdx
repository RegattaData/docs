title: "Backup & Restore"
---

The Regatta platform also allows the user to back up the database and later restore it.

<Note>
   NOTE: Currently this is an intrusive operation. When performed, the database is not available
  until the operation is completed. This process may take some time. With the current builds -
  expect both backup and restore to take up to 30 minutes. 
</Note>

This will dramatically improve in future Regatta platform releases.
