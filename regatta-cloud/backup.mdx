title: "Backup"
---

To back up the database, complete any desired operation and stop any access to the database,
either manual or through an application. Do note that this is a recommended procedure as the
database will not be accessible once the backup process starts. Once ready, click the
**Backup/Restore** button on the left-hand-side. You will transition to the **Backup/Restore** page.

Clicking on the **\+ CREATE NEW BACKUP** button will redirect you to the New Backup page. Name the new backup, say **my-1st-cluster-backup** and select the cluster to be backed-up, then click the **SAVE** button.

A popup window will appear asking you to confirm that you would like to perform the backup (as the cluster will stop and become unavailable). Once you click on **CONFIRM**, the platform will stop the cluster and the backup process will start. The backup will appear to be in the **IN PROGRESS** state.

Once completed, the status will change to **SUCCESS** and the platform will restart the cluster.
Wait until the cluster is back in the **RUNNING** status. Now that backup will be available when
one would like to restore the database back to that point in time.
