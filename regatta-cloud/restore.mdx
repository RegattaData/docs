title: "Restore"

If you already backed up your database, you may restore it to that point-in-time as follows.

Go back to the clusters page by clicking the **Clusters** button on the Left-Hand-Side. Select **the cluster you created. **Now, run:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employees
```

You will see the content of the table. Let’s delete an entry. We will delete the employee with the lowest salary:

```SQL
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE employee_salary = (SELECT min(employee_salary) FROM employees)
```

Run the previous SELECT command again:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employees
```

Now we will see that John Doe has left the company, or in other words, he does not appear in
the employee table anymore.

Let’s restore that table from the backup. Go back to the **Backup/Restore** page. Click on the cog to the right of the desired backup, select **Restore** and click on it. You will be redirected to the Restore screen.

In our example we will restore from **my-1st-cluster-backup** to the same cluster:
**my-1st-regatta-cluster.** Since we have only one cluster and one backup, they are already selected. If that is not the case, please select the cluster from which the backup was created, the name of the backup and the target cluster.

Once we have done that, we will click **SAVE.** A pop window will ask us to confirm the restore
operation – let’s do that by clicking **CONFIRM.**

A pop up message will appear briefly at the top of the page, notifying us that the restore 
operation was initiated. The Platform will stop the cluster and restore the database to the selected point-in-time. Let’s wait for the backup process to complete and the cluster is back in the **Running** state.  

Connect to the cluster and perform:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employees
```

We will see that John Doe is back in the company and in the table.
