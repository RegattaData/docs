title: Restore
---

If you already backed up your database, you may restore it to that point-in-time as follows.

Go back to the clusters page by clicking the **Clusters** button on the Left-Hand-Side. Select **the 
cluster you created.** 

Now, run: 

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employees
```

You will see the content of the table:

Let’s delete an entry. We will delete the employee with the lowest salary:

```SQL
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE employee_salary = (SELECT min(employee_salary) FROM employees)
```

Run the previous SELECT command again:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employees
```

Now we will see that John Doe has left the company, or in other words, he does not appear in 
the employee table anymore.

Now let’s restore that table from the backup. Go back to the **Backup/Restore** page.

Click on the cog next to the desired backup, select **Restore** and click on it.

You will be redirected to the Restore screen.

In our example we will restore from **my-1st-cluster-backup** to the same cluster:
**my-1st-regatta-cluster.** Since we have only one cluster and one backup, they are already 
selected. If that is not the case, please select the cluster from which the backup was taken, the 
name of the backup and the target cluster.

Once we have done that, we will click **SAVE.** A pop window will ask us to confirm the restore 
operation (Figure 29 Approve restore) – let’s do that by clicking **CONFIRM.**

A pop up message will appear briefly at the top of the page, notifying us that the restore 
operation was initiated. The Platform will stop the cluster and restore the database to the selected point-in-time. As can be seen below (Figure 30 Database in restore), the cluster is in the 
process of Restoring.

Let’s wait for the backup process to complete and the cluster is back in the **Running** state. 

Perform 
```SQL
SELECT * FROM employees
```

We will see that John Doe is back in the company and in the table.
