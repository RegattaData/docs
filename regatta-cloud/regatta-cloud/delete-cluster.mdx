title: Delete Cluster
---

Once a cluster has served its purpose, you may delete it. To delete a cluster, go to the clusters 
page, select the cluster to be deleted by clicking on the cog and selecting Delete by hovering 
over it, as can be seen here:

<Frame caption="Figure 34 Delete cluster">
  <img src="/images/33.png" />
</Frame>

Click on the delete option. A pop up window will ask you to enter the cluster name (donâ€™t worry, 
it appears at the top of the message) as can be seen here:

<Frame caption="Figure 35 Confirm deletion">
  <img src="/images/34.jpg" />
</Frame>


Once the name is entered (no leading or following spaces please), the **CONFIRM** button will 
become available. Now you may confirm it:

<Frame caption="Figure 36 Cluster deletion enabled">
  <img src="/images/35.jpg" />
</Frame>

Once confirmed, a message stating that the deletion started will appear at the top and the 
**Status** of the cluster will change to **Deleting.** From this point, the cluster is unavailable. Once 
removed completely, it will disappear from the cluster list.
