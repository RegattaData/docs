title: "Delete Cluster"
---

Once a cluster has served its purpose, you may delete it. To delete a cluster, go to the clusters page, select the cluster to be deleted by clicking on the cog to its right and selecting Delete by hovering over it.

Click on the **delete** option. A pop up window will ask you to enter the cluster name (donâ€™t worry, it appears at the top of the message). Once the name is entered (no leading or following spaces please), the **CONFIRM** button will become available. Click it.

Once confirmed, a message stating that the deletion started will appear at the top and the
**Status** of the cluster will change to **Deleting.** From this point, the cluster is unavailable. Once
removed completely, it will disappear from the cluster list.
