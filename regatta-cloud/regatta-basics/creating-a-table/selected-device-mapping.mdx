title: Selected Device Mapping
---

If you do decide to select the devices to where the table will be mapped, you may specify them. 

NOTE: It’s an all-or-nothing option. You cannot specify the devices for the table and let Regatta 
select the devices for the indexes. If you decide to specify mapping, then you need to add all 
required mapping.

The first command should display the devices that are used in the cluster.
We enter SHOW DEVICES in the CLI command line:

```SQL
SHOW DEVICES
```

Then press SEND. In return we get the following:

<Frame caption="Figure 10 SHOW DEVICES">
  <img src="/images/10.png" />
</Frame>

The next command will be the CREATE TABLE command. This command will look as follows 
(note the usage of the devices). Let’s create a similar table called **workers.** Enter the following 
command:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE workers (
 worker_key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX WITH (devices = (m10d1)),
 worker_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
 worker_salary INT,
 worker_department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
WITH (devices = (m10d1))
```

Running it will create the desired table.

<Frame caption="Figure 11 CREATE TABLE mapped devices.">
  <img src="/images/11.png" />
</Frame>

Enter the SQL command:

```SQL
SHOW TABLES
```

In response, the following will be displayed:

<Frame caption="Figure 12 Mapped devices table created.">
  <img src="/images/12.jpg" />
</Frame>

We can see the table with all the columns and the device mapping. 

We will continue here using the **employees** table.
