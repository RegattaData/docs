title: Linear Scaling
---

One of the most important features of the Regatta Database is its linear scaling capabilities. We 
will show that as the cluster grows, the same OLAP query will have a faster response time 
proportional to the cluster growth.

To demonstrate that, we will create 2 new clusters that will also use the **Deploy Demo Data**
option. This is a switch button in the **Create New Cluster** screen. Selecting that will create 2
predefined tables and populate them with predefined data.
