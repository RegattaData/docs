Regatta is a scale-out distributed database that is designed for elasticity, including the dynamic distribution and location of table and index data. Regatta also provides optional manual parameters to further optimize data distribution of tables and indexes. This document aims to provide insights and information to define optimal data distribution for table and index data. Most of the manual configuration options described in this document will become obsolete with the release of enhanced automation and dynamic adaptation features in future Regatta versions.

The rest of this introduction chapter provides a brief outline of Regatta’s components and processes. For more details about Regatta’s architecture, please refer to the documentation.
