title: Delete Entry from Table
---


Now let us remove the employee with the maximal salary; that will be Jane Roe (Figure 17). We will execute the following SQL command:

```SQL
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE employee_salary = (SELECT max(employee_salary) FROM employees)
```

<Frame caption="Figure 17 DELETE FROM command">
  <img src="/images/17.jpg" />
</Frame>

We will run the previous SELECT again to see what we get now:

<Frame caption="Figure 18 DELETE outcome">
  <img src="/images/18.png" />
</Frame>

As expected, Jane Roe was deleted.
