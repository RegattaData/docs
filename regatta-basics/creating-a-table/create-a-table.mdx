In this section we will demonstrate how to create a new table.

Please note that most Regatta SQL commands are exactly like PostgreSQL. When they divert, 
we will note that clearly. 

To create a table (or for executing other SQL commands) we will open the CLI window by 
clicking the **Connect** button next to our cluster. Clicking it will open the following window:

</Frame>

In the input line we will enter the desired SQL command.

Assume you would like to create the following table:

Table: employees

- employee_key INT
- employee_name VARCHAR (40)
- employee_salary INT
- employee_department VARCHAR (50)

In Regatta, you may define in which devices (storage devices that are local to each node in the 
cluster) the table should be stored in as well as indexes if specified. In the following example we 
will show both methods.
