title: Default Device Mapping
---

The simple option is creating the cluster without specifying any device. If that method is chosen, 
then the platform will map all tables and indexes to a single device in the cluster.

To create the above table, enter the following SQL command:

```SQL
 CREATE TABLE employees (
 employee_key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX,
 employee_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
 employee_salary INT,
 employee_department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
```

In response you will see the following:

<Frame caption="Figure 8 CREATE TABLE default mapping">
  <img src="/images/8.png" />
</Frame>

Enter SQL command SHOW TABLES:

```SQL
SHOW TABLES
```

In response, the table details will be displayed as can be seen below:

<Frame caption="Figure 8 Default mapping table created">
  <img src="/images/9.png" />
</Frame>

We can see the **employee** table with all the columns and the device mappings. If we do not 
specify the mapping, the system will distribute the table rows across all the devices and choose
a single random device for the indexes.

**Notes:**

- This mapping is not necessarily the most performant, but it is the simplest behavior, and
it allows someone to easily get started (which is the purpose of this document).
- When there is more than one device used for indexing, we need to define range
separators that will define how to map the indexes to the different devices. It is up to the 
user to specify this mapping. In the default mapping the indexes are mapped to a single 
device and therefore there is no need for range separators, so it defaults to **no range 
separators.**
