title: Starting the System
---

Now you will need to start all the services. 

Start with all the non-RDB modules, namely Sequencer, GDD, DCM, followed by the RDBs.

For the RDBs, when deploying a Regatta database on more than a single node, the user is 
required to create a **module configuration file** named **rdb.config** on each of the nodes that the 
RDB module will be installed on. This file should reside in the same location of the 
**cluster.config**, namely:

```sql
/opt/regatta/1.0/<module>/conf/rdb.config
```

The file should contain the id that was given to the module in the configuration file:

```sql
rdb=<module id
```

For example, if in the configuration file, the module id was defined as follows:

```sql
module_4_id=3
```

Then the rdb.config file should contain the following line:

```sql
rdb=3
```

To start the services, execute the following command: 

```sql
sudo systemctl start regatta-1.0-<module_name>.service
```

where module is one of the Regatta software modules.

For example:

```sql
sudo systemctl start regatta-1.0-rdb.service
```
