title: Unique Module Configuration 
---

As stated previously, the bottom 3 lines are unique per module. The lines are (as an example):

- core_total_ram_budget_for_module_mb = 29908
- ranger_dev_num=1
- core_pdbg_port=5004

These 3 lines should be set as follows:

### core_total_ram_budget_for_module_mb

The capacity which is dedicated to the module in MB. The guidelines are:

1. Decrease the total capacity by 1 GB for the OS usage
2. For the GDD, DCM, Sequencer dedicate at least 300MB each
3. For the RDB dedicate whatever is left on the server.

For example, in a system with 20GB RAM, if there’s only an RDB installed – the RAM budget will 
be 19GB for the RDB module. If there are also GDD, Sequencer and DCM, give each 300MB, and 
the rest of the RAM, 18.1GB, will go to the RDB.

Do that by updating the configuration file for each module accordingly.

### ranger_dev_num

Leave it set to 1.

### core_pdbg_port

This number should be unique for each module in the server and should be a number in the 
range of 5000 and above.
