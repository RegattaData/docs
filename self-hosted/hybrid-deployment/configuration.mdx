title: Configuration

The second step creates all the configuration files. In this step we will be able to edit the files for 
each Regatta module and change the module specific parameters such as dedicated RAM 
capacity etc.

Continue by running:

```
./setup_cluster.sh distribute rpm config
```

Once stopped, follow the steps in the Configuration File section and apply changes as you 
desire. For example, you can change the RAM allocated for each Regatta software module.


<Note> Note that the script opened the ports that appear in the configuration files for all Regatta 
modules, prior to this stage. So, if you decide to change ports, you also will need to update the 
firewall prior to executing the next step. </Note>
