title: Backup
---

To back up the database, complete any desired operation and stop any access to the database, 
either manual or through an application. Do note that this is a recommended procedure as the 
database will not be accessible once the backup process starts. Once ready, click the 
**Backup/Restore** button on the left-hand-side. You will transition to the following page:

Clicking on the + CREATE NEW BACKUP button will redirect you to the New Backup page:

Give a name to the new backup, say **my-1st-cluster-backup** and select the cluster to be 
backed-up, then click the **SAVE** button.

A popup window will appear (as seen below) asking you to confirm that you would like to 
perform the backup (as the cluster will stop and become unavailable).

Once you click on CONFIRM, the platform will stop the cluster and the backup process will 
start. The backup will appear to be in the **IN PROGRESS** state.

Once completed, the status will change to **SUCCESS** and the platform will restart the cluster. 
Wait until the cluster is back in the **RUNNING** status. Now that backup will be available when 
one would like to restore the database back to that point in time. This will be demonstrated in 
the next section.
