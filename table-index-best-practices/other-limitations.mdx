title: Other Limitations

### Fully define a new table before using it
The current release of Regatta does not support `ALTER TABLE` operations after the table has been created.  It is still possible to split the table creation into multiple statements if the first statement contains the `SET NOT READY` clause:

```sql
CREATE TABLE SET NOT READY <table> …
```

The table is still not accessible at this point. It is then possible to use `ALTER TABLE` statements with this table.  For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE <table> ADD COLUMN <column> <type> <constraint> …
```

The last statement in the table creation sequence should then be 

```sql
ALTER TABLE <table> SET READY;
```

Note that the table cannot be used (rows cannot be inserted), until after the completion of the `SET READY` command.  That command declares that the table is fully defined and available for use.

### Index on a single column only

The current release of Regatta supports indexes only on a single column.  In the case that a combination of columns needs to be indexed, a compound field may be created and maintained, with the index on the compound field.

### PRIMARY KEY INDEX
Note that in the current release, Regatta requires the keyword `INDEX` after the constraint `PRIMARY KEY`.
