The following 2 syntaxes are supported:

```sql
CASE WHEN condition THEN result
[WHEN ...]
[ELSE result]
END
```

Or

```sql
CASE expression
WHEN value THEN result
[WHEN ...]
[ELSE result]
END
```


In the upper syntax:

Each condition is an expression that returns a boolean result. If the condition result is true, then the value of the `CASE` expression is the result that follows the condition, and the remainder of the `CASE` expression is not processed. If the condition result is false, then any subsequent `WHEN` clauses are examined in the same manner. If no `WHEN` condition result is true, the value of the `CASE` expression is the result of the `ELSE` clause. If the `ELSE` clause is omitted and no condition is true, the result is NULL.

In the lower syntax:

The first expression is computed, then compared to each of the value expressions in the `WHEN` clauses until one is found that is equal to it. If no value matches the expression, the result of the `ELSE` clause is returned. If the `ELSE` clause is omitted and no condition is true, the result is NULL.

The data types of input expression and each value must be the same or compatible data type that can be implicitly converted. See [Type Conversion](/sql/data-types/type-conversion).

The `CASE()` can be used in all the statements and their clauses that allow a valid expression. This includes the clauses: s`elect_list`, `IN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`.
