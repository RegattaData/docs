#### Return the rows that their column value is included in the subquery:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE c_custkey IN (SELECT o_custkey FROM orders
WHERE o_date>'2022-12-12');
```

#### Return the rows that their expression is not included in the subquery values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE o_date NOT IN ('2022-12-12','2022-11-12');
```

#### Return the rows based on a row constructor:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE (o_totalprice,o_name) IN
                            (SELECT MAX(o_totalprice),o_name
                            FROM orders GROUP BY o_name
);
```
