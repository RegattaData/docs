title: "IN and NOT IN"
---

The `IN` and `NOT IN` operators check if an expression is included or not included in the values returned by a subquery.

## Synopsis

---

```sql
expression [NOT] IN (subquery)
row_constructor IN (subquery)
```

## Description

---

The left-hand expression or `row_constructor` are evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result.

The result of `IN` is “true” if any equal subquery row is found. The result is “false” if no equal row is found. Vice versa, the result of `NOT IN` is “false” if any equal subquery row is found. The result is “true” if no equal row is found. Those two cases include the case where the subquery returns no rows.

## Parameters

---

`expression`

A column_name or an expression to be compared with the subquery. The subquery (in the right-hand side in the parenthesized) must return exactly one column.

`row_constructor`

A composite value that builds a row value. The subquery (in the right-hand side in the parenthesized) must return the exact same number of columns.

The constructed row columns order should match the subquery columns data types.

## Examples

---

Return the rows that their column value is included in the subquery:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE c_custkey IN (SELECT o_custkey FROM orders
                    WHERE o_date>'2022-12-12');
```

Return the rows that their expression is not included in the subquery values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE o_date NOT IN ('2022-12-12','2022-11-12');
```

Return the rows based on a row constructor:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE (o_totalprice,o_name) IN
                            (SELECT MAX(o_totalprice),o_name
                             FROM orders GROUP BY o_name
                            );
```
