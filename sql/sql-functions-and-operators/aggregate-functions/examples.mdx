#### Basic aggregations based on groups of values

```sql
SELECT SUM(o_totalprice) AS sum_of_totalprice,
COUNT(o_totalprice) AS total_number_of_purches,
AVG(o_totalprice) AS avg_price,
STDDEV(o_totalprice) AS stddev_from_avg,
MIN(o_date) AS the_minimum_date,
MAX(o_date) AS the_maximum_date,
o_name
FROM orders
GROUP BY o_name
ORDER BY sum_of_totalprice;
```

Calculate the mathematical aggregations for any given different `o_name` value.


#### Using the aggregation as a subquery

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE o_totalprice = (SELECT MAX(o_totalprice)
FROM orders
);
Returns the row with the highest `o_totalprice`.
```

#### Using the aggregation with no `GROUP BY` column

```sql
SELECT
SUM((sale_price-purchse_price)*number_of_sold_items) AS total_profit
FROM transactions;
```

Calculate the total profit of all the different transactions.

#### Count by distinct column or expression

```sql
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT c_name) as customers FROM customers;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT purchse_price+sale_price) FROM transactions;
```
