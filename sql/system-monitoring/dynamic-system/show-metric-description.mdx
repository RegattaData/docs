title: SHOW METRIC DESCRIPTION
---

Contains information about the dynamic system data metrics (see [Dynamic System Data](/sql/system-monitoring/dynamic-system)).

The output is ordered by the `metric_name` column.

Note: All the metrics are for the current time and not historical or cumulative.

The following table lists the outputâ€™s columns:



|Column name|Data type|Description|
| :- | :- | :- |
|METRIC_NAME|`VARCHAR(255)`|<p>Unique short name for the metric. This is the filter column.</p><p>Note that some metrics appear in more than 1 view (in both [SHOW DATABASE METRICS](/sql/system-monitoring/dynamic-system/show-database-metric) and [SHOW MODULE METRICS](/sql/system-monitoring/dynamic-system/show-module-metrics)).</p>|
|METRIC_ID|`INT`|The unique metric identifier.|
|DESCRIPTION|`VARCHAR(4000)`|Metric description.|

The following table lists the available metrics and their descriptions:

| 13 | Row insertions rate | The rate of row insertions per second |
| 14 | Row output rate | The rate of rows returned in result sets per second |
| 15 | Row updates rate | The rate of row updates per second |
| 16 | Statements error rate | The rate of failed statements per second |
| 24 | SELECT statements average latency | The average execution time of successful SELECT statements in milliseconds |
