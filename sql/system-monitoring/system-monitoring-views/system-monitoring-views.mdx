title: "Using System Monitoring Views"
---

System views are used to track database objects (as part of the [Database Catalog Data](/sql/system-monitoring/database-catalog)), system static configuration (as part of the [System Catalog Data](/sql/system-monitoring/system-catalog)) and dynamic metrics on the system performance (as part of the [Dynamic System Data](/sql/system-monitoring/dynamic-system)).

The system monitoring views are exposed by the `SHOW` commands. Those `SHOW` commands are Regatta proprietary commands and support the options listed below.

## Synopsis

```sql
SHOW view_name [ LIKE 'pattern' ][ IN object_type object_name ] [ ROWS BETWEEN n AND m ]

where object_type is:
{ TABLE | INDEX | DEVICE }
```

## Parameters

**`view_name`**

The system catalog view name.

**`LIKE '<pattern>'`**

Filters the view output by its main object (e.g filter by table name in `SHOW TABLES` view, filter by index name in `SHOW INDEXES` view). The filter uses case-sensitive pattern matching, with the support of optional leading and/or trailing percent signs.

The percent sign (%) stands for sequences of zero or more characters.

**`IN object_type object_name`**

Show only results within the scope of a specific object in the relevant system view data.
Possible object types and the views to which they apply:

| Object type | System view                                                                              |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IN TABLE`  | `SHOW INDEXES`,<br />`SHOW COLUMNS`, <br />`SHOW TABLE DEVICES`,<br />`SHOW CONSTRAINTS` |
| `IN INDEX`  | `SHOW INDEX DEVICES`                                                                     |
| `IN DEVICE` | `SHOW DEVICE METRICS`                                                                    |
| `IN MODULE` | `SHOW MODULE METRICS`                                                                    |

The **table_name/index_name/device_id** should be the fully-qualified name.

Note that input names are converted to lower-case unless enclosed by double quotes. Therefore: `IN TABLE 'Employees'` and `IN TABLE 'employees'` both refer to the table\
named employees, while `IN TABLE '“Employees”'` refers to the table named\
`Employees`.

**`ROWS BETWEEN n AND m`**

Used to return only part of the output rows. This can be used to retrieve the results in parts and
avoid exceeding the client's memory limitations.

Note:

- If the size of the output exceeds the client memory, an error is returned.
- If objects are added and/or removed from the view in between two queries of
  consequent row ranges, an existing object may be returned in both queries or missing
  from both queries.
- If the number of requested rows is larger than the actual number of rows in the view, the
  command should succeed and return only the existing rows.
- The row number is zero-based.

## Examples

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'my%';
SHOW COLUMNS IN TABLE 'my_table';
SHOW COLUMNS LIKE '%product%' IN TABLE 'my_table';
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%my' ROWS BETWEEN 100 AND 150;
```
