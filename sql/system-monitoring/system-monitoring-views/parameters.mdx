### `view_name`

The system catalog view name.


### `LIKE '<pattern>'`

Filters the view output by its main object (e.g filter by TABLE_NAME in `SHOW TABLES view,
filter by INDEX_NAME` in `SHOW INDEXES view`). The filter uses case-sensitive pattern
matching, with the support of optional leading and/or trailing percent signs.

The percent sign (%) stands for sequences of zero or more characters.

### `IN object_type object_name`

Show only results within the scope of a specific object in the relevant system view data.
Possible object types and the views to which they apply:

| Object type | System view                                                                 |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IN TABLE`  | `SHOW INDEXES`, `SHOW COLUMNS`, `SHOW TABLE DEVICES`, `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`    |
| `IN INDEX`  | `SHOW INDEX DEVICES`                                                        |
| `IN DEVICE` | `SHOW DEVICE METRICS`                                                       |
| `IN MODULE` | `SHOW MODULE METRICS`                                                       |


The __table_name/index_name/device_id__ should be the fully-qualified name.

Note that input names are converted to lower-case unless enclosed by double quotes.

Therefore: `IN TABLE 'Employees'` and `IN TABLE 'employees'` both refer to the table
named employees, while `IN TABLE '“Employees”'` refers to the table named
`Employees`.


### `ROWS BETWEEN n AND m`

Used to return only part of the output rows. This can be used to retrieve the results in parts and
avoid exceeding the client's memory limitations.

Note:

- If the size of the output exceeds the client memory, an error is returned.
- If objects are added and/or removed from the view in between two queries of
consequent row ranges, an existing object may be returned in both queries or missing
from both queries.
- If the number of requested rows is larger than the actual number of rows in the view, the
command should succeed and return only the existing rows.
- The row number is zero-based.
