title: SHOW INDEX
---

This view has a single row for each index in the database. The output is ordered by the
(`table_name,index_name`) columns.

Data can be filtered with `IN TABLE` table_name syntax.

Note, this view contains both indexes created explicitly by the user and indexes created implicitly for `PRIMARY
KEY` and `UNIQUE` and `REFERENCES` constraints.

The following table lists the outputâ€™s columns:

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TABLE_NAME | VARCHAR(127) | The table name |
| INDEX_NAME | VARCHAR(127) | The index name. This is the filter column. |
| IS_UNIQUE | BOOLEAN | True if the index is unique. False if not. |
| COLUMN_NAME | VARCHAR(127) | The index column name |
| DEVICES | VARCHAR(1000) | List of devices on which the index is stored, separated by comma.<br/>Note: The output is trimmed after 1000 chars. To see the full list of devices use [SHOW INDEX DEVICES](/sql/system-monitoring/database-catalog/show-index-devices). |
| RANGE_SEPARATORS | VARCHAR | Separators of the key ranges of the segments, if any.<br/>The column output max size is limited by the [Max SQL statement length](/sql/appendices/database-limitations). |
