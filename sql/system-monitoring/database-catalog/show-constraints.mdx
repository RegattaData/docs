title: SHOW CONSTRAINTS
---

This view has a row for every constraint in every table in the database, except for `NULL` constraints. Those are presented as the column `IS_NULLABLE` at `SHOW COLUMNS` view.

The output is ordered by the `table_name` column.

Data can be filtered with `IN TABLE` table_name syntax.

The following table lists the outputâ€™s columns:

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TABLE_NAME | `VARCHAR(127)` | The table name. This is the filter column. |
| COLUMN_NAME | `VARCHAR(127)` | The column the constraint is set on |
| CONSTRAINT_TYPE | `CHAR(1)` | `r` = foreign key constraint, `p` = primary key constraint, `u` = unique constraint |
| REF_TABLE_NAME | `VARCHAR(127)` | For foreign key constraint: The referenced table the foreign key is pointing to. Otherwise null. |
| REF_COL_NAME | `VARCHAR(127)` | For foreign key constraint: The column in the reference table the foreign key is referring to. Otherwise null. |
