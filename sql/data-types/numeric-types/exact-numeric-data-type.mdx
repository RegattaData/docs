Notes:

- The types ``SMALLINT``, ``INTEGER``, and ``BIGINT`` store integrals, that is, numbers without fractional components, of various ranges. Attempts to store values outside of the allowed range will result in an error.
- Numeric:
    - The precision (p) is the maximum number of significant digits in the whole number (that is, the number of digits to both sides of the decimal point).
    - `NUMERIC` precision (p) must be between 1 and 1000.
    - The scale (s) is the maximum number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
    - `NUMERIC` scale (s) must be between 0 and 1000.
    - If `p` and s are not specified, the column can contain up to 131072 digits before the decimal point, and up to 16383 digits after the decimal point.
    - If only `p` is specified, then the s is zero.
