This guide contains the Regatta SQL specification.

Regatta implements the PostgreSQL dialect.

**Regatta is compatible with PostgreSQL wherever possible** and as long as it doesn't affect Regatta's performance or functionality. Naturally, not every feature and option supported by PostgreSQL is also supported by Regatta, and Regatta has its own unique features and options that are not supported by PostgreSQL and for which Regatta has its own SQL specifications.
