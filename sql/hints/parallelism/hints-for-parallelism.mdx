title: Hint for parallelism of distributed operations
---

With the `DISTRIBUTE` hints, the system will try to distribute the operation specified by the hint across the
specified number of nodes. It may not distribute it across more than the given number, but it may distribute it
across less than the given number of nodes if there are not enough available nodes.
