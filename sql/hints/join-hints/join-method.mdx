title: "Hint - Join method"
---

### Synopsis

`JOIN METHOD ( [ joint_alias, ] { HASH | NL } )`

This hint instructs the system which method to use for performing the join operation - either hash-join or nested loop. This hint is honored as long as it’s possible – some joins cannot be done using certain methods, and in those cases the hint won’t be applied.

The **join_alias** parameter is optional. If it’s absent, the hint applies to all the joins in the statement (including explicit and implicit joins). Also, if there is a `JOIN METHOD` hint without alias, any other `JOIN METHOD` hint is contradictory and results in ignoring all the hints.

Specifying multiple hints with different methods for the same alias is contradictory and is not allowed.

### Example

```sql
SELECT /*++ JOIN METHOD (dept_join, HASH) */ name, id
FROM (staff s JOIN org o ON s.deptno = o.deptno) as dept_join
WHERE o.division = 'EASTERN';
```
