title: Hint - Join distribution method
---

### Synopsis:

`JOIN DISTRIBUTION METHOD ( [ joint_alias, ] { HASH DIVIDE | BROADCAST } )`

This hint instructs the system which method to use for *distributing* the input records for the join operation – either hash-divide or broadcast. This hint is honored as long as it’s possible – some distribution methods are not applicable for certain join methods, and in those cases the hint won’t be applied.

The **join_alias** parameter is optional. If it’s absent, the hint applies to all the joins in the statement (including explicit and implicit joins). Also, if there is a `JOIN DISTRIBUTION METHOD` hint without alias, any other `JOIN DISTRIBUTION METHOD` hint is contradictory and results in ignoring all the hints.

Specifying multiple hints with different distribution methods for the same alias is contradictory and is not allowed.
