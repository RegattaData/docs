title: "ALTER USER"
---

Modify existing user definitions.

## Synopsis

```
ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD password
```

## Description

The `ALTER USER` command should be used to modify an existing user password.

Currently all the users have the same privileges and can manage users.

## Parameters

**`user_name`**
The name of the user to modify.

**`password`**
The new password string. See [CREATE USER](/sql/managing-users/create-user) for password requirements.

## Examples

Alter the user password:

```sql
ALTER USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'Xr5kg7s3m@aAB'
```

## Compatibility

The `ALTER USER` statement is a Regatta extension as there is no SQL standard for managing users.
