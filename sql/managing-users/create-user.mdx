Create a new user account in the database.

## Synopsis

```
CREATE USER user_name WITH PASSWORD password
```

## Description

`CREATE USER` creates a new user account in the database. Currently all the users have the same privileges and can manage users.

## Parameters

**`user_name`**

The name of the user to create.

The user name should be unique and conform with the [Identifiers Limitations](/sql/appendices/indentifiers-limitations).

**`password`**

The password string.

Password requirements:

- Password length should be between 8 and 100 characters
- A password must contain at least 3 of the following character classes:

  ○ Upper case characters

  ○ Lower case characters

  ○ Numbers

  ○ Symbols. Any of the following symbols can be used. The list is enclosed in double
  quotes. “ ' ~ \! @ # \$ % ^ & \* ( ) \_ - \+ =   [ ] \\ / \< \> , . ; ? ‘ : | (space)”.

## Examples

**Create a new user:**

```sql
CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'Rdyv#1Cguko';
```

## Compatibility

The `CREATE USER` statement is a Regatta extension as there is no SQL standard for managing users.
