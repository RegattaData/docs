title: "DELETE"
---

Removes rows from an existing table.

## Synopsis

---

```
DELETE FROM table_name [ [ AS ] alias ]
[ WHERE condition ]
[ RETURNING output_expression [[ AS ] output_name ] [, ...] ]
```

## Description

The `DELETE` command removes rows from a specified table. The deletion can be specific by using the `WHERE`clause to identify the needed rows to delete. Without the `WHERE` clause, the command removes all the rows in the table and leaves it empty.

## Parameters

**`table_name`**

The name of the table to delete rows from.

**`alias`**

A substitute alias name for `table_name`. The alias name should match the [Identifiers Limitations](/sql/appendices/indentifiers-limitations).

**`WHERE`**

The condition to filter the rows for deletion. If this parameter is omitted, all the rows in the table are
removed.

The `WHERE` clause can contain the rows `ROWID` with = or `IN` condition.

**`RETURNING output_expression`**

Returns the given expression for every row deleted by the command. Refer to the expression
parameter of [SELECT](/sql/dql/select/select#parameters) for specification of the output_expression parameter.

## Outputs

On successful completion, the `DELETE` command returns the count of the deleted rows.

## Examples

---

Delete rows based on a specific filter:

```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE o_date < '2020-1-1' ;
```

Delete rows based on another table filter:

```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE o_date <= (SELECT max(o_date) FROM old_orders);
```

Delete a row based on its ROWID:

```sql
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE ROWID = 12345678;
```

## Compatibility

---

The `DELETE` command conforms to the SQL standard with the exception of the `RETURNING` functionality.
