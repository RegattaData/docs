title: Parameters
---

### `table_name`
The name of the table to be inserted with the new rows.

### `alias`
A substitute alias name for `table_name`. The alias name should match the [Identifiers Limitations](/sql/appendices/indentifiers-limitations).

### `column_name`
A list of columns in the table. The columns can be listed in any order, as long as the expressions in the
VALUES clause are listed in the same order. Each missing column is set to `NULL` or to its default value
specified in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. In case of a missing column that has no default value and
the column has a `NOT NULL` constraint, the command fails.

This parameter is optional. If no column names were specified, the values are assigned to the columns
in the order of columns defined in the table’s creation. If the number of values is less than the number
of columns, the values are assigned to the first columns and the rest are assigned default values, or
`NULL` for columns with no default value. If such columns for which there is no specified value doesn’t
have a default value and also has the `NOT NULL` constraint, the command fails with an error.

### `VALUES`
Specifies the values to insert into the corresponding columns in the table. The data types of the values
should be compatible with the data types of the corresponding columns in the column list (note that in some cases, Regatta will overcome mismatches with implicit conversion).

The list of values can only contain literals (e.g. 'hello'), the `DEFAULT` and `NULL` keywords, expressions
or functions that can be computed at the planning time such as `NOW()` or 5*50.

String literals and date literals in the `VALUES` list must be enclosed by single quotes (').

### `expression`

An expression or value to assign to the corresponding column. The expression is given as a string and
Regatta attempts to convert it to the desired data type.

### `DEFAULT`
Store the column default value as it's defined for the column at the [CREATE TABLE](/sql/ddl-commands/create-table) or [ALTER TABLE](/sql/ddl-commands/alter-table)
statements.

Note that if all the columns in the table have `DEFAULT` values, the following syntax can be used to
insert a single row with all the columns set to the default values:
INSERT INTO -table name- DEFAULT VALUES;

### `query`
A SELECT statement that supplies the rows to be inserted. See [SELECT](/sql/dql/select).

### `RETURNING output_expression`

Returns the given expression for every row inserted by the command. Refer to the **expression**
parameter of [SELECT](/sql/dql/select/parameters) for specification of the **output_expression** parameter.

If only `ROWID` is specified as the **output_expression**, the returned ROWIDs are returned in pairs of
(First ROWID, number of rows) for each set of consecutive ROWID numbers.
