The commands to create the tables referenced in these examples can be found in the [CREATE TABLE](/sql/create-table/examples) Example.

#### Insert of a single row:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (c_custkey,c_name,c_gender)
VALUES (1,'John Doe1','M');
```

#### Insert of multiple rows in a single command:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (c_custkey,c_name,c_gender)
VALUES (2,'John Doe2','M'),(3,'John Doe3','M'),(4,'John Doe4','M');
```

#### Insert partial column list:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (o_order_id,o_name,o_custkey,o_date)
VALUES (1022,'order of John Doe1',1,DEFAULT);
```

In this example, we specifically write the values of the mentioned columns.

The column `o_date` is loaded with its DEFAULT value as defined in the table definition.

Missing columns (`o_totalprice`) will write their default value, or NULL. If no DEFAULT was defined and the
column is set with the NOT NULL constraint, the `INSERT` will fail.

#### Insert based on a query result:

```sql
INSERT INTO old_orders SELECT * FROM orders WHERE o_date < '2020-01-01';
```
