title: SET TRANSACTION
---

Define the characteristics of the current transaction.

## Synopsis


```sql
SET TRANSACTION transaction_mode [, ...]
where transaction_mode is one of:
ISOLATION LEVEL { SERIALIZABLE |
REPEATABLE READ |
READ COMMITTED }
{ READ WRITE | READ ONLY }
```

## Description

The `SET TRANSACTION` command defines the characteristics of the current transaction. It has no effect on any subsequent transactions.

Note that this command should be the first statement in the transaction (after `BEGIN/START TRANSACTION`). If this is not the case, an error is returned.


## Parameters


##### `ISOLATION LEVEL`

Defines how the transaction is isolated from other transactions. When not specified in the `SET TRANSACTION` command, the transaction isolation level is the level that was defined for the client connection or the database default.

Note that in all isolation levels, transactions always see their own (uncommitted) changes. 

      ###### `READ COMMITTED`

      Each statement sees only data committed before it started execution; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed by concurrent transactions during the statement's execution.

      Note that two statements can see different data, even though they are within a single transaction, if other transactions commit changes after the first statement starts and before the second statement starts.

      This is the database default isolation level. 

      ###### `REPEATABLE READ`

      Statements within the transaction only see data committed before the transaction began; it never sees either uncommitted data or changes committed by concurrent transactions during the transaction's execution.

      In contrast to `READ COMMITTED` level, in this level all the statements within a transaction see the same version of the data.

      ###### `SERIALIZABLE`

      Each statement within the transaction reads the last committed version of any row. Regatta provides that any concurrent execution of a set of serializable transactions is guaranteed to produce the same effect as running them one at a time in some order. In addition, in Regatta this mode provides *external consistency*: The order of execution of transactions as it appears to any other transaction is the commitment order.

##### `READ WRITE`

Define the transaction as capable of both read and write changes in the database. This is the default.

##### `READ ONLY`

Define the transaction as capable of only reading data from the database. Attempts to write will fail the statement and the transaction.


## Examples


##### Start a transaction and set its isolation mode:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
INSERT INTO customers (c_custkey ,c_name,c_gender)
VALUES (1,'John Doe1','M');
```

##### Start a transaction, set its isolation level and set it to READ ONLY:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ , READ ONLY;
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

## Compatibility

The `SET TRANSACTION` command conforms to the SQL standard.
