#### Create a table as not ready and alter it to modify its definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE SET NOT READY parts WITH (devices = (m1d2, m2d5, m3d3));
ALTER TABLE parts
ADD COLUMN p_partkey INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX WITH (devices = (m1d2)),
ADD COLUMN p_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE INDEX
WITH (devices = (m1d2, m2d5, m3d3), range_separators = ('j', 'p'));
ALTER TABLE parts
ADD COLUMN p_date DATE NOT NULL ;
ALTER TABLE parts SET READY;
```

This example creates a table and builds it gradually with `ALTER TABLE` commands, and eventually finalizes it
with `SET READY`.

Note that the `ALTER TABLE` command can only work as long as the parts table is defined as `NOT READY`.
