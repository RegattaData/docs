`ALTER TABLE` changes the metadata definition of an existing table in the current database (and in the future
the current schema).

The table must be in the `NOT READY` state, otherwise the command results in an error. A table is in `NOT
READY` state if itâ€™s created with the `CREATE TABLE SET NOT READY` option, and until the `ALTER TABLE`
`SET READY` command is performed on it.
