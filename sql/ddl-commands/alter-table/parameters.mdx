### `table_name`

The name of an existing table to alter.

### `action`

##### `ADD [ COLUMN ]`

Adds a new column to the table, using the same syntax as in [CREATE TABLE](/sql/ddl-commands/create-table). The column
name must be unique within the table and conform with the [Identifiers Limitations](/sql/appendices/indentifiers-limitations).

##### `Column_name`

The name of the added column.

##### `data_type`
Data type of the new column. For more information on the supported data types, refer to [Data Types](/sql/data-types).

The rest of the parameters used in this command are described in the [CREATE TABLE](/sql/ddl-commands/create-tabl) command.
