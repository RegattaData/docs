title: DROP TABLE
---
Remove a table.

## Synopsis

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name [RESTRICT]
```

## Description

The `DROP TABLE` command is used to remove a table from the current database (and in the future the current
schema), including all its rows, its metadata and related indexes.

## Parameters

##### `table_name`
The name of the table to be dropped.

##### `RESTRICT`
Return an error if any column in the table to be dropped is referenced by another tableâ€™s column
(foreign key).
This is the default behavior, kept for compatibility with PostgreSQL.

## Examples

##### Drop a table:

```sql
DROP TABLE customers;
```

Drop the table `customers`.


## Compatibility
