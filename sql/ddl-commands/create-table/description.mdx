The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to create a new empty table, with columns, indexes and constraints, in the current database.

Once created, unless set as `NOT READY`, the tableâ€™s definition is fixed and cannot be altered, additional indexes cannot be added or removed.

Index and constraint names are auto-generated by Regatta.

Note: If there is `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY` or `REFERENCES` constraints, then there must be an `INDEX` clause following it. Otherwise, there could be either zero or one `INDEX` clause. The `INDEX` clause must be after all the constraint clauses (if any).
