#### Query on a table, filtering by a column that is not indexed:

```SQL
EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM employees WHERE num_rewards = 0;
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| id | parent | operation | information |
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1 | 0 | MULTI OP | |
| 2 | 1 | FULL SCAN | on: employees |
| 3 | 1 | FILTER | num_rewards = 0 |
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

The same query, when the column is indexed and the query planner chooses to use the index to determine
which rows should be deleted:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM employees WHERE num_rewards = 0;
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| id | parent | operation | information |
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1 | 0 | PARTIAL SCAN | on: employees |
| 2 | 1 | INDEX SCAN | using key: num_rewards |
| 3 | 2 | VALUES SCAN | |
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

In processing the above query, the DB treats the expression in the WHERE clause as a list of values (one
value in this case) that are looked up in the index.

In the following query, it is treated as a boolean expression that generate a range scan, thus there is no values
scan in the plan:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM employees WHERE num_rewards > 3;
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| id | parent | operation | information |
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 1 | 0 | PARTIAL SCAN | on: employees |
| 2 | 1 | INDEX SCAN | using key: num_rewards |
+----+--------+------------------+-----------------------------------------+
```
