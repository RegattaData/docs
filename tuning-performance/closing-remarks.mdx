Sometimes things don’t work as expected. Sometimes it’s as simple as a syntax error. Sometimes it’s a little more complex like an index that should have been used but instead a full scan is done. Perhaps a sub-query with an `IN` needs to replace a join. Or a statement is taking a lot longer than it should.

Finding out what is going on can be as simple as prefixing the statement with `EXPLAIN VERBOSE`.

In any event, please feel free to contact Regatta support.
