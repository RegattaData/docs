title: Creating a Table
---

Assume you would like to create the following table:

Table: employees
- employee_key INT
- employee_name VARCHAR (40)
- employee_salary INT
- employee_department VARCHAR (50)

In Regatta, you define in which devices (storage devices that are local to each node in the cluster) the table should be stored in as well as indexes if specified. 

NOTE: In most of the command examples, one can simply copy the command from this document and paste it into the CLI. 

However, there are some commands that are presented in a nice format that will be clearer to the reader which cannot be copied into the CLI as-is. In these cases, there’s a foot noted for these commands which are in a CLI-friendly format, where one can copy the command from.
The first command should display the devices that are used in the cluster.

We enter SHOW DEVICES in the CLI command line:

```sql
SHOW DEVICES;
```

In return we get the following:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| DEVICE_ID | MODULE_ID | CAPACITY     | TYPE    |
--------------------------------------------------
| m10d1     |        10 | 402653184000 | SCRATCH |
```

The next command will be the CREATE TABLE command. Let’s create a table called __employees__ This command will look as follows: 

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX,
  employee_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  employee_salary INT,
  employee_department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
```

Running this command will create the desired table. 

```sql
statement executed successfully 
```

Enter the SQL command SHOW TABLES:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

In response, the following will be displayed (zoomed out): 

```sql
| TABLE_NAME    | IS_READY | PRIMARY_KEY_COLUMN | DEVICES |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| employees     | true     | employee_key       | m10d1   |
```

We can see the table with all the columns and the device mapping. Going forward, we will continue using the __employees__ table.
