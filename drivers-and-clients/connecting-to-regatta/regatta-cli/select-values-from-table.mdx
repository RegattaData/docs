title: Select Values from Table
---

The SELECT command is also the same as PostgreSQL.

Run the following command to see all values in the table

```sql
SELECT * from employees;
```

The CLI will display all entries as follows:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_key | employee_name | employee_salary | employee_department |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|            1 | John Doe      |           10932 | DevOps              |
|            2 | Richard Roe   |           18324 | Legal               |
|            3 | Jane Roe      |           20411 | SoftwareDev         |
|            4 | Rachel Roe    |           19555 | Support             |
```


Obviously, we can perform a more complex SELECT command. For example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, employee_salary FROM employees WHERE employee_salary > 18324;
```

The output, as expected, will be Jane Doe and Rachel Roe since their salary is more than 18324. 

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_name | employee_salary |
-----------------------------------
| Jane Roe      |           20411 |
| Rachel Roe    |           19555 |
```
