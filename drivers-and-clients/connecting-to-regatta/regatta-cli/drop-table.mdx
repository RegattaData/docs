title: Drop Table
---

Now we will remove the table and get back to an empty database. First, letâ€™s run:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

This will present all the tables in the database:

Now, perform the following SQL DROP command: 

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

And then:

```sql
SHOW TABLES
```

And indeed, there are no tables in the database.

```sql
statement executed successfully
| TABLE_NAME | IS_READY | PRIMARY_KEY_COLUMN | DEVICES | TABLE_METADATA |
