Run the CLI. 

```
/opt/regatta/1.0/connect/cli/bin/client_cli
```


You will get the following prompt:

```
rdb>
```

Choose one of the cluster RDB IPs, say aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp from the configuration file and run the following command in the CLI:

```
rdb>\connect user=admin pass=RegattaDefault1234! url=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp
```

In this command we used the default credentials. See the Credentials section below for details.
In response you will get: 

```
Successfully connected to clusterÂ 
```

<Note> NOTE: From this point forward the rdb> prompt will be omitted. </Note>
