title: Insert Values
---

Inserting values into Regatta is no different than PostgreSQL.

The following command will insert a few values into the __employees__ table.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (
  employee_key,
  employee_name,
  employee_salary,
  employee_department)
VALUES 
  (1,'John Doe', 10932, 'DevOps'),    
  (2,'Richard Roe', 18324, 'Legal'),
  (3,'Jane Roe', 20411, 'SoftwareDev'),
  (4,'Rachel Roe', 19555, 'Support');
```  

In response we will see:

```sql
statement executed successfully Â 
```
