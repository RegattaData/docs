To install the client lib, save the RPM on the server from which you want to deploy and install it as follows:

```
yum install ./regatta-client-<version>.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

Once the client lib is installed, you may proceed installing the different available clients.

<Note> Note: It is mandatory to deploy the client lib before deploying any Regatta driver. </Note>
