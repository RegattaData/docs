title: "Connecting Applications to Regatta"
---

Regatta supports a wide range of integrations to help you connect your applications to the database. These include native drivers, ORMs, CLI tools and moreâ€”each designed to fit seamlessly into your development environment.

Drivers are available in two modes:

- **Bundled** with the Regatta client library for a simplified all-in-one setup.
- **Standalone**, allowing dynamic linking to the Regatta client at runtime for greater flexibility.

Explore the languages and frameworks you work with and discover the right tools for building with Regatta.
