title: Python Drivers
---

The Regatta Python driver is used in the same manner as any Python database driver. You need 
to install the driver, create the dependency, and start using it.

You may replace the existing Python driver with the Regatta one so the same application will 
work with the Regatta database. Please note that you might be required to perform minor
changes to some of the SQL commands that Regatta implements a little differently.
