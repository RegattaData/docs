title: Run a Python Application
---

Once you installed the driver, you will need an IP of the cluster and a user’s credentials. You will 
use them in the same manner as done with other databases.

In the following example, there’s a code that performs some of the operations similar to the 
ones done in the Regatta Platform section. 

You will need to add the reference to the regatta driver:

```Python
from pyregatta import connect
```

Note that you should import all relevant classes based on the functionality of your application 
and its requirements.

In the next step you will need to add the cluster IP and the user’s credentials. These can be 
attained by following the described in the External Access to the Regatta Database chapter. 

```Python
host = "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp"
user = "MyUserName"
password = "SomeSophisticatedPassword"
```

Then all the code that performs the different SQL commands should be changed accordingly.

Below is an example of some of the code. Note that this example is also available as part of the 
downloaded driver.

Unlike the Platform, in the commands used by the driver we need to specify the device mapping
when creating a table. In the example below we will use a single device.



```Python
from pyregatta import connect 
host = "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp"
user = "MyUserName"
password = "SomeSophisticatedPassword"
# The connection is automatically closed when the block is exited
with connect(user, password, host) as conn:
 
 # Now you can perform database operations using the cursor
 with conn.cursor() as cursor:
 
 # Create table
 cursor.execute("""CREATE TABLE employees (
employee_key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX WITH (devices = (m10d1)),
employee_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
employee_salary INT,
employee_department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
) WITH (devices = (m10d1)) """)
 
 # Insert values
 cursor.execute("""INSERT INTO employees (
employee_key, 
employee_name, 
employee_salary, 
employee_department)
VALUES 
(1,'John Doe', 10932, 'DevOps'), 
(2,'Richard Roe', 18324, 'Legal'),
(3,'Jane Roe', 20411, 'SoftwareDev'),
(4,'Rachel Roe', 19555, 'Support') """)
 
 # Select all
 cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
 rows = cursor.fetchall()
 
 # Print the results
 for row in rows:
 # Print the entire row
 print(row)
 """
 You can use this syntax to print a specific column:
 print(row.id)
 """
```

The following is the output of the driver (Figure 47):

And so on. All commands performed in the Regatta Platform section can be performed in the 
same manner using a Python application.
