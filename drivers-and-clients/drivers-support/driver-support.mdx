title: Driver Support

Regatta supports various drivers. In this document we will cover the following:

- Python Driver
- JDBC Driver
- Node.js Driver

Please note that currently we support most CentOS7 and CentOS8 based distributions. To use 
the driver, please use a Linux machine with one of the supported distributions. One may also 
use a docker container or a VM with a supported Linux distribution. In all cases, this must run 
over a native X86_64 CPU architecture.
For MacOS running over ARM CPUs we currently offer a docker-based solution.

To download a driver or get the full list of available drivers, please reach out to Regatta support.
If you require a different OS or CPU architecture to be supported, please contact Regatta 
Support as well.
