title: Type ORM
---

The Regatta TypeORM tool functions similarly to any other databaseâ€™s TypeORM tool. You 
should be able to replace your existing TypeORM tool with the Regatta one, allowing your 
application to work seamlessly with the Regatta database.

To run a TypeORM based application, you must first install the Node.js driver. Please follow the 
steps in the Node.js Driver section to achieve that.
