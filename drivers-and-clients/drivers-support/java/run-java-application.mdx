title: Running a Java Application

Once you installed the driver, you will need an IP of the cluster and a user’s credentials. You will 
use them in the same manner as done with other databases.

In the example below, there’s a code that performs some of the operations done in the Regatta 
Platform section. Note that this example is also available as part of the downloaded driver.

In the next step you will need to add the cluster IP and the user’s credentials. These can be 
attained by following the described in the External Access to the Regatta Database chapter.

```java
host = "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp"
user = "MyUserName"
password = "SomeSophisticatedPassword"
```

Then all the code that performs the different SQL commands should be changed accordingly.

Below is an example of some of the code. Note that this example is also available as part of the 
downloaded driver.

```Java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
public class DatabaseExample {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 // Connection details
 String url = "jdbc:regatta:aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp";
 String user = "MyUserName";
 String password = "SomeSophisticatedPassword";
 try {
 // Establish the connection to the database
 try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
 
 // Create a statement to execute SQL queries
 try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
 
 // Create table
 String createTableSQL = "CREATE TABLE employees (
 employee_key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX WITH (devices = (m10d1)),
 employee_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
 employee_salary INT,
 employee_department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
 ) WITH (devices = (m10d1))";
 stmt.executeUpdate(createTableSQL);
 // Insert values
 String insertValuesSQL = "INSERT INTO employees (
 employee_key, 
 employee_name, 
 employee_salary, 
 employee_department) 
 VALUES (1,'John Doe', 10932, 'DevOps'), 
 (2,'Richard Roe', 18324, 'Legal'),
 (3,'Jane Roe', 20411, 'SoftwareDev'),
 (4,'Rachel Roe', 19555, 'Support')";
 stmt.executeUpdate(insertValuesSQL);
 
 // Fetch data
 String fetchSQL = "SELECT * FROM employees";
 ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(fetchSQL);
 
 
 // Print the results
 while (rs.next()) {
 // Retrieve data from each row
 int id = rs.getInt("employee_key");
 String name = rs.getString("employee_name");
 int salary = rs.getInt("employee_salary");
 String department = rs.getString("employee_department");
 // Print the data
 System.out.println("Employee Key: " + id);
 System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
 System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
 System.out.println(
 "Employee Department: " + department);
 System.out.println();
 }
 }
 }
 } catch (SQLException e) {
 System.out.println("Database access error.");
 e.printStackTrace();
 }
 }
}
```

Unlike the Platform, in the commands used by the driver we need to specify the device mapping 
when creating a table. In the example below we will use a single device.

And so on. All commands performed in the Regatta Platform section can be performed in the 
same manner using a Java application.
