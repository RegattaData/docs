title: JBDC Driver
---

The Regatta JDBC driver is used in the same manner as any JDBC database driver. You need to 
install the driver, create the dependency, and start using it.

You may replace the existing JDBC driver with the Regatta one so the same application will work 
with the Regatta database. Please note that you might be required to perform minor changes to 
some of the SQL commands that Regatta implements a little differently.

Currently we support most of the common API functionality. If you do use a JDBC command 
which is not supported, you will receive the following exception:

```java
class RegFeatureNotSupportedException extends SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
```

In such a case, contact Regatta Support for assistance.
