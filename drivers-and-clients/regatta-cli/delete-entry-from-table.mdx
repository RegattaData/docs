title: Delete Entry from Table
---

At this stage we will remove the employee with the highest salary; that will be Jane Roe. We will execute the following SQL command:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_salary = (SELECT max(employee_salary) FROM employees);Â 
```

We will run the previous SELECT again to see what we get now:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_name | employee_salary |
-----------------------------------
| Richard Roe   |           20202 |
| Rachel Roe    |           19555 |
```

As expected, Jane Roe was deleted.
