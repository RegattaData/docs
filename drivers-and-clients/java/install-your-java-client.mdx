## Drivers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JDBC">
    1. [Download the JDBC driver](/drivers-and-clients/download-drivers-and-clients).\
       The driver is distributed as a **single JAR file**.

    <Note>
      Regatta provides a shaded JDBC driver which includes all required dependencies. A non-shaded driver can be provided upon request.
    </Note>
    2. Add the Regatta JDBC driver to your Maven project:

       **Option A — Using system scope (local JAR path):**

       ```xml
       <dependency>
         <groupId>dev.regatta</groupId>
         <artifactId>regatta-jdbc</artifactId>
         <version>1.9.0</version>
         <scope>system</scope>
         <systemPath>${project.basedir}/my_drivers/regatta-jdbc-1.8.0-shaded_full.jar</systemPath>
       </dependency>
       ```

       <Note>
         When using system scope\*\*, \*\*ensure that the driver exists at the path specified by `systemPath`. If you are using build tools such as Gradle or deploying to application servers, choose the option that best matches your environment.
       </Note>
       **Option B — Provided scope (when included by your runtime environment):**

       ```xml
       <dependency>
         <groupId>dev.regatta</groupId>
         <artifactId>regatta-jdbc</artifactId>
         <version>1.9.0</version>
         <scope>provided</scope>
       </dependency>
       ```

    ### Notes

    - **Java 8** or newer is required to use the Regatta JDBC driver.
    - If you are using the **Full** driver package, the Regatta client library is included automatically.\
      If you are using the **Standalone** version, ensure that the [client library is installed](/drivers-and-clients/client-lib).
    - The Regatta JDBC driver implements the **JDBC 4.2 API**. Refer to the [official JDBC documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/package-summary.html) for full API details
