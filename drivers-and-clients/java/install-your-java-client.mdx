## Drivers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JDBC">
    1. [Download the JDBC driver](/drivers-and-clients/download-drivers-and-clients). The driver is distributed as a single JAR file.

    <Note>
      Regatta provides a shaded JDBC driver which includes all required dependencies. A non-shaded driver can be provided upon request.
    </Note>
    2. Add the Regatta JDBC driver to your Maven project:

       **Option A — Install locally (recommended):**

       Install the driver locally in your environment:

       ```bash
       mvn install:install-file \
         -Dfile=regatta-jdbc-1.8.0-shaded_full.jar \
         -DgroupId=dev.regatta \
         -DartifactId=regatta-jdbc \
         -Dversion=1.8.0 \
         -Dpackaging=jar
       ```

       Then add the JDBC driver as a dependency to your project:

       ```xml
       <dependency>
         <groupId>dev.regatta</groupId>
         <artifactId>regatta-jdbc</artifactId>
         <version>1.8.0</version>
       </dependency>
       ```

       **Option B — Provided scope (when included by your runtime environment):**

       ```xml
       <dependency>
         <groupId>dev.regatta</groupId>
         <artifactId>regatta-jdbc</artifactId>
         <version>1.8.0</version>
         <scope>provided</scope>
       </dependency>
       ```

    ### Notes

    - **Java 8** or newer is required to use the Regatta JDBC driver.
    - If you are using the **Full** driver package, the Regatta client library is included automatically. If you are using the **Standalone** version, ensure that the [client library is installed](/drivers-and-clients/client-lib).
    - The Regatta JDBC driver implements the **JDBC 4.2 API**. Refer to the [official JDBC documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/package-summary.html) for full API details
    - Regatta supports most of the common JDBC functionality. If you do use a JDBC command which is not supported, you will receive the following exception:

      ```java
      class RegFeatureNotSupportedException extends SQLFeatureNotSupportedException
      ```

## ORM frameworks

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hibernate">
    1. [Download the Regatta Hibernate dialect](/drivers-and-clients/download-drivers-and-clients). The dialect is distributed as a single JAR file.
    2. Add the Regatta Hibernate dialect to your Maven project:

       **Option A — Install locally (recommended):**

       Install the dialect locally in your environment:

       ```bash
       mvn install:install-file \
         -Dfile=regatta-hibernate-1.1.0.jar \
         -DgroupId=dev.regatta \
         -DartifactId=regatta-hibernate \
         -Dversion=1.1.0 \
         -Dpackaging=jar
       ```

       Then add the Hibernate dialect as a dependency to your project:

       ```xml
       <dependency>
         <groupId>dev.regatta</groupId>
         <artifactId>regatta-hibernate</artifactId>
         <version>1.1.0</version>
       </dependency>
       ```

       **Option B — Provided scope (when included by your runtime environment):**

       ```xml
       <dependency>
         <groupId>dev.regatta</groupId>
         <artifactId>regatta-hibernate</artifactId>
         <version>1.1.0</version>
         <scope>provided</scope>
       </dependency>
       ```

       <Note>
         The Regatta Hibernate dialect is compatible with Hibernate 6.x (built and tested with Hibernate 6.4.4.Final) and requires Java 17 or newer. Refer to the [official Hibernate documentation](https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/6.4/) for installation instructions and API details.
