The Regatta Hibernate ORM functions similarly to any other databaseâ€™s Hibernate ORM. You
should be able to replace your existing Hibernate dialect with the Regatta one, allowing your
application to work seamlessly with the Regatta database. 

To run a Hibernate based application, you must first set up the JDBC driver. Please follow the
steps in the JDBC Driver section to achieve that.
