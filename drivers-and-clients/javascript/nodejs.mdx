title: Node.js Driver
---

The Regatta Node.js driver functions similarly to any other Node.js database driver. You should 
be able to replace your existing Node.js driver with the Regatta driver, allowing your application 
to work seamlessly with the Regatta database. However, please note that some minor 
modifications to certain SQL commands may be necessary, as Regatta implements them 
slightly differently.
