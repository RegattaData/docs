title: Installing the Driver
---

Option 1:

1. Copy the node-regatta driver tar file provided by Regatta and place it in the directory 
where you want to install it. This is typically the directory where your project's 
package.json file is located.

2. Run the following command:

```node
npm install path/to/node-regatta-*.tar.gz
```

The driver will install the necessary dependencies and update the package-lock.json file 
accordingly. The output should look something like this:

Option 2:

Add node-regatta dependency to your projectâ€™s package.json:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
 "node-regatta": "file: path/to/node-regatta.tgz"
}
```
