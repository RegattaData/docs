## Drivers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    1. [Download the Node.js driver](/drivers-and-clients/download-drivers-and-clients), and save the `.tgz` file locally (typically next to your `package.json`).
    2. Install the driver:

       **Option A — Direct install:**

       Install the driver locally in your environment:

       ```bash
       npm install path/to/node-regatta-<version>_<type>.tgz
       ```

       This will install the driver, pull in required dependencies, and update your `package-lock.json`.

       **Option B — Add as a local package dependency:**\
       Add the driver to your project’s `package.json`:

       ```json
       "dependencies": {
        "node-regatta": "file: path/to/node-regatta.tgz"
       }
       ```

    ### Notes

    - **Node.js 16** or newer is required to use the Regatta Node.js driver.
    - If you are using the **Full** driver package, the Regatta client library is included automatically. If you are using the **Standalone** version, ensure that the [client library is installed](/drivers-and-clients/client-lib).

## ORM frameworks

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeORM">
    1. [Download the Regatta TypeORM package](/drivers-and-clients/download-drivers-and-clients).
    2. Install the Regatta TypeORM package:

       ```bash
       npm install typeorm-regatta-<version>.tgz
       ```

    <Note>
      Regatta provides a dedicated fork of TypeORM that includes the Regatta dialect inside the TypeORM core. The Regatta TypeORM package (`typeorm-regatta`) is based on [**TypeORM 0.3.20**](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/releases/tag/0.3.20) and is distributed as a separate `.tgz` package. Because it is a fork, it should be used instead of the standard `typeorm` dependency, and compatibility is aligned to that upstream version.
