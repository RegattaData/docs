title: "Client Library"

The Regatta client library is a core component required by all Regatta drivers. It provides the underlying communication layer that enables your applications to interact with the Regatta database. Before installing any language-specific driver or tool, the client library must be installed on your system.

Regatta Drivers are available in two modes:

- **Bundled** with the Regatta client library for a simplified all-in-one setup.
- **Standalone**, allowing dynamic linking to the Regatta client at runtime for greater flexibility.

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    Copy the client RPM package to your target Linux machine and run: 

    ```bash
    yum install ./regatta-client-<version>.el7.x86_64.rpm
    ```

    Once installed, the shared library will be placed in the system library path, typically:

    ```bash
    /usr/lib64/libregattaclient<major.version>.so.<full.version>
    ```

    You can verify installation with: 

    ```
    ls /usr/lib64/libregattaclient*.so.*
    ```

    This confirms that the client library is now available for linking by the drivers.
