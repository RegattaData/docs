title: Installing the Driver
---
Extract the tar file to the desired location and add the dependency to
your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
{
  dependencies:
  regatta_dart_driver:
    path: path/to/dart/driver/
}
```

Once you run `dart pub get`, The driver will install the necessary
dependencies and update the pubspec.lock file accordingly.
