title: Running a Dart Application

After installing the driver, you will need an IP of the cluster and user credentials. These will be used in the same way as with other databases.

In the following example, you'll find code that performs operations similar to those described in the Regatta Platform section. 

To begin, import the `package:regatta_dart_driver/regatta_dart_driver.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:regatta_dart_driver/regatta_dart_driver.dart';
```

Next, add the IP address and credentials obtained earlier (see External Access to the Regatta Database):

```dart
final dbUser = "YourUserName";
final dbPassword = "YourPassword";
final dbUrl = "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:pppp"; // <host>:<port>
```

Any code that performs SQL commands should be updated accordingly.

To help you get acquainted with the Regatta API for Dart, weâ€™ve provided a simple code 
example below.


```javascript
const {getConnection} = require("node-regatta");
async function main() {
 const dbUser = "MyUserName";
 const dbPassword = "SomeSophisticatedPassword";
 const dbUrl = "aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd:pppp";
 
 try {
 // Get a database connection
 let connection = await getConnection(dbUser, dbPassword, dbUrl);
 console.log("Connected to the database");
// Create the employees table
const createQuery = `
 CREATE TABLE employees (
key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX WITH (devices = (m10d1)),
name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
salary INT,
department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
) WITH (devices = (m10d1))
`;
await connection.execute(createQuery);
 console.log("Employees table created");
 // Insert values into table 
 const insertQuery = ` 
 INSERT INTO employees (key, name, salary, department) VALUES
 (1, 'John Doe', 10932, 'DevOps'),
 (2, 'Richard Roe', 18324, 'Legal'),
 (3, 'Jane Roe', 20411, 'Sale'),
 (4, 'Rachel Roe', 19555, 'Support')
 `;
 
 await connection.execute(insertQuery);
 console.log("Data inserted into employees table");
 // Select all values
 const selectQuery = "SELECT * FROM employees";
 let cursor = await connection.execute(selectQuery);
 // Fetch the results
 let result = await cursor.fetchAll();
 // Print the results
 console.log(result.rows);
 // Closing the connection will also close all open cursors.
 await connection.close();
 console.log("Connection closed");
} catch (error) {
 console.error("Error: ", error.message);
}
}
 
main();
```

Following is the output of the application:

Note that all commands performed in the Regatta Platform section can be performed in the same manner using the Dart driver.
