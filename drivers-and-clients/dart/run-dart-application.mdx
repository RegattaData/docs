After installing the driver, you will need an IP of the cluster and user credentials. These will be used in the same way as with other databases.

In the following example, you will find code that performs operations similar to those described in the Regatta Platform section.

To begin, import the `package:regatta_dart_driver/regatta_dart_driver.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:regatta_dart_driver/regatta_dart_driver.dart';
```

Next, add the IP address and credentials obtained earlier (see External Access to the Regatta Database):

```dart
final dbUser = "YourUserName";
final dbPassword = "YourPassword";
final dbUrl = "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:pppp"; // <host>:<port>
```

Any code that performs SQL commands should be updated accordingly.

To help you get acquainted with the Regatta API for Dart, we have provided a simple code example below. Additionally, a more comprehensive example is included in the driver package under **examples/dart_regatta_example.dart**. This documented example demonstrates common tasks such as creating connections, executing queries, and accessing the result set.

Below is an example of some of the code.

Note that a more robust example is also available as part of the downloaded driver.

```dart
import 'package:regatta_dart_driver/regatta_dart_driver.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final dbUser = 'Username';
  final dbPassword = 'Password';
  final dbUrl = '11.22.33.44:5555';

  final connection = await Connection.open(
    dbUrl,
    dbUser,
    dbPassword,
  );

  await connection.runTx((conn) async {
    await conn.execute(
      "CREATE TABLE users("
      "id INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX, "
      "name VARCHAR(128))",
      ignoreRows: true,
    );
    
    final resultSet = await conn.execute(
      "INSERT INTO users (id, name) "
      "VALUES (100, 'Mario'), "
      "(200, 'Barbara'), "
      "(300, 'Marcelo'), "
      "(400, 'Henry')",
    );

    print(
      'Total number of affected rows in the result set: '
      '${resultSet.affectedRows}',
    );
  });

  await connection.runTx((conn) async {
    await conn.execute(
      "INSERT INTO users (id, name) "
      "VALUES (500, 'Bella')",
    );

    await conn.rollback();
  }, settings: settings);

  final resultSet = await connection.execute('SELECT * FROM users');
  print('Result set metadata: ${resultSet.schema.columns}');
  print("Rows retrieved from 'users' table: $resultSet");
  print(
    "Map of first row in 'users' table: "
    "${resultSet[0].toColumnMap()}",
  );

  await connection.execute('DROP TABLE users');
  await connection.close();
}
```

Note that all commands performed in the Regatta Platform section can be performed in the same manner using the Dart driver.
