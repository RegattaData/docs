Regatta makes it simple to obtain the latest drivers, client libraries, and integration tools directly from your Regatta Cloud account.

## Accessing the Download Portal

1. [Log in to your Regatta Cloud account](https://docs.regatta.dev/regatta-cloud/regatta-cloud/access-the-cloud).
2. In the left-hand navigation bar, click **Clients & Tools**.
3. Select your desired language or tool to Download.
4. Select the tab of the client or tool you wish to download. For example, click **JavaScript** to view NodeJS and TypeORM packages.

## Understanding the Version Matrix Table

Once you select a particular client or tool (e.g., **JavaScript → NodeJS**), you will see a table like this:

| OS    | Architecture | Version | Type       | Supported DB Versions   |            |
| ----- | ------------ | ------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Linux | Intel        | 1.3.0   | Full       | 1.0.0.1297 \+           | [Download] |
| Linux | Intel        | 1.3.0   | Standalone | 1.0.0.1297 \+           | [Download] |
| Linux | Intel        | 1.1.0   | Full       | 1.0.0.1034 – 1.0.0.1296 | [Download] |
| Linux | Intel        | 1.1.0   | Standalone | 1.0.0.1034 – 1.0.0.1296 | [Download] |

Below is a description of each column:

1. **OS** - Indicates the operating system for which this package was built.
2. **Architecture** - The CPU architecture supported by this package.
3. **Version** - The specific release number of the driver or tool. Follows Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch).
4. **Type** - Can be of the following:\
   - **Full**: Includes the Regatta client library bundled together with the driver. Recommended for a “zero-prep” installation: copy, extract, and run, without any additional dependencies.\
   - **Standalone**: Contains only the driver (no embedded client library). Requires that you have already installed (or will install) the [**Regatta Client Library**](https://docs.regatta.dev/drivers-and-clients/client-lib) separately. Useful if you want to manage client library upgrades independently of the driver.
5. **Supported DB Versions** - Specifies which Regatta Database cluster versions are compatible with this driver/tool.\
   Examples:\
   - `1.0.0.1034 – 1.0.0.1296` means “This release works with any Regatta cluster running versions `1.0.0.1034` through `1.0.0.1296`.”\
   - `1.0.0.1297 +` means “This release requires Regatta `1.0.0.1297` or later.”
6. **Download Button** - Click **Download** to retrieve that specific RPM/TAR/GZ (or compressed ZIP) package.

## After Download

1. Place the downloaded client in your workspace.
2. Navigate to the appropriate section for [installation instructions](https://docs.regatta.dev/drivers-and-clients/connecting-applications-to-regatta) and usage examples.
