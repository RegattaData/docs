title: "Regatta CLI"
---

The Regatta CLI is an easy way to access your Regatta database. To access the database, you need a user’s credentials and an active IP on the Regatta Database cluster.

## Connecting to the CLI

Run the CLI:

```
/opt/regatta/1.0/connect/cli/bin/client_cli
```

You will get the following prompt:

```
rdb>
```

Use your credentials to connect to the database:

```
rdb>\connect user=admin pass=RegattaDefault1234! url=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:ppp
```

In response you will get:

```
Successfully connected to cluster 
```

<Note>
  NOTE: From this point forward the rdb\> prompt will be omitted.
</Note>

## Examples

### Creating a table

Assume you would like to create the following table:

`employees`

- `employee_key INT`
- `employee_name VARCHAR (40)`
- `employee_salary INT`
- `employee_department VARCHAR (50)`

Run the create table command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_key INT PRIMARY KEY INDEX,
  employee_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  employee_salary INT,
  employee_department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
```

Running this command will create the desired table:

```sql
statement executed successfully 
```

Enter the SQL command `SHOW TABLES`:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

In response, the following will be displayed (zoomed out):

```sql
| TABLE_NAME    | IS_READY | PRIMARY_KEY_COLUMN | DEVICES |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| employees     | true     | employee_key       | m10d1   |
```

We can see the table with all the columns and the device mapping. Going forward, we will continue using the **employees** table.

### Inserting values

Inserting values into Regatta is no different than PostgreSQL.

The following command will insert a few values into the **employees** table:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (
  employee_key,
  employee_name,
  employee_salary,
  employee_department)
VALUES 
  (1,'John Doe', 10932, 'DevOps'),    
  (2,'Richard Roe', 18324, 'Legal'),
  (3,'Jane Roe', 20411, 'SoftwareDev'),
  (4,'Rachel Roe', 19555, 'Support');
```

In response we will see:

```sql
statement executed successfully  
```

### Select values from table

The `SELECT` command is also the same as PostgreSQL.

Run the following command to see all values in the table:

```sql
SELECT * from employees;
```

The CLI will display all entries as follows:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_key | employee_name | employee_salary | employee_department |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|            1 | John Doe      |           10932 | DevOps              |
|            2 | Richard Roe   |           18324 | Legal               |
|            3 | Jane Roe      |           20411 | SoftwareDev         |
|            4 | Rachel Roe    |           19555 | Support             |
```

Obviously, we can perform a more complex `SELECT` command. For example:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, employee_salary FROM employees WHERE employee_salary > 18324;
```

The output, as expected, will be Jane Doe and Rachel Roe since their salary is more than 18324:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_name | employee_salary |
-----------------------------------
| Jane Roe      |           20411 |
| Rachel Roe    |           19555 |
```

### Update entry

Let’s give Richard Roe a raise.

```sql
UPDATE employees SET employee_salary=20202 WHERE employee_name='Richard Roe';
```

Execute the `SELECT` command from the previous section and see if Richard Roe appears now:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_name | employee_salary |
-----------------------------------
| Richard Roe   |           20202 |
| Jane Roe      |           20411 |
| Rachel Roe    |           19555 |
```

Indeed, Richard Roe is now with a higher salary.

### Delete entry from table

At this stage we will remove the employee with the highest salary; that will be Jane Roe. We will execute the following SQL command:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_salary = (SELECT max(employee_salary) FROM employees); 
```

We will run the previous `SELECT` again to see what we get now:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| employee_name | employee_salary |
-----------------------------------
| Richard Roe   |           20202 |
| Rachel Roe    |           19555 |
```

As expected, Jane Roe was deleted.

### Drop table

Now we will remove the table and get back to an empty database. First, let’s run:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

This will present all the tables in the database:

Now, perform the following SQL `DROP` command:

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

And then:

```sql
SHOW TABLES
```

And indeed, there are no tables in the database:

```sql
statement executed successfully
| TABLE_NAME | IS_READY | PRIMARY_KEY_COLUMN | DEVICES | TABLE_METADATA |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
