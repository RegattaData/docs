title: GDD- Global Deadlock Detector
---

The GDD module is responsible for detecting circular distributed dependencies between 
transactions in the system and resolving them.

When setting up the Regatta Cluster you will need to determine what modules will reside where. 
You may have an RDB on each of the servers. The other modules should be deployed only once.

The recommended configuration is:
- RDB – on all server
- GDD, DCM, Sequencer – all on the same server alongside one of the RDBs

Once decided, please distribute the different RPMs according to selected configurations.

The RPMs are located in the package you received from Regatta support. Save it in a desired 
directory and open it. The RPMs will be located under

```
./deploy/ansible/roles/regatta.rdb/files
```
Install the RPMs using the following command:

```javascript
sudo yum install <path/to/regatta_rpm>
```

Where `<path/to/>` is the full or relative path to where the rpm was saved on.

Once completed, the installation of the RPM will also include an example configuration file
called cluster.template for each module.
