title: "Select Values from Table"

The SELECT command is also the same as PostgreSQL. Run the following command to see all values in the table:

```SQL
SELECT * from employees
```

The CLI will display all entries.

Obviously, we can perform a more complex SELECT command. For example:

```SQL
SELECT employee_name, employee_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE employee_salary > 18324
```

The output, as expected, will be Jane Doe and Rachel Roe since their salary is more than 18324.
