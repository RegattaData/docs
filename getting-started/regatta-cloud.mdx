title: "Getting Started Using Regatta Cloud"
---

The Regatta Cloud is an easy way to get you started. In the following sections we will guide you on how to access Regatta cloud, deploy a Regatta database, and access it using the WebCLI interface.

**Note**: If you would like to create a self-hosted cluset, please refer to the [**Sefl-Hosted-Deployment**](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/prerequisites) section.

It is assumed that you are already registered with Regatta and received a Username (email used to register) and Password to access the Regatta Cloud Platform. It is also assumed that a registered account(s) is associated with the user.

If this is not the case, please reach out to Regatta support.
