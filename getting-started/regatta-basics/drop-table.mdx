title: "Drop Table"
---

Now we will remove the table and get back to an empty database. First, let’s run:

```SQL
SHOW TABLES
```

This will present all the tables in the database. 

Now, perform the following SQL DROP command:

```SQL
DROP TABLE employees
```

And don’t forget to also drop the workers table:

```SQL
DROP TABLE workers
```

Then run:

```SQL
SHOW TABLES
```

And indeed, there are no tables in the database.
