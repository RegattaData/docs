title: "Delete Entry from Table"
---

Let's remove the employee with the maximal salary; that will be Jane Roe we have seen previously. We will execute the following SQL command:

```SQL
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE employee_salary = (SELECT max(employee_salary) FROM employees)
```

We will run the previous SELECT again and as expected, Jane Roe was deleted.
