title: "Insert Values"
---

Inserting values into Regatta is no different than PostgreSQL. The following command will insert a few values into the employees table:

```SQL
INSERT INTO employees (
 employee_key, employee_name, employee_salary, employee_department)
VALUES 
 (1,'John Doe', 10932, 'DevOps'), (2,'Richard Roe', 18324, 'Legal'),
 (3,'Jane Roe', 20411, 'SoftwareDev'),
 (4,'Rachel Roe', 19555, 'Support')
```

Next we will access these values.
