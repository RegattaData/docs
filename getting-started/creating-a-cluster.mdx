title: "Creating a Cluster"

You may select to use one of the available clusters or create a new one. In this example, we will create a new cluster.

Clicking on the **\+ NEW CLUSTER** button will redirect you to the **Create New Cluster** screen.

Choose a **Cluster Name** for the cluster (one that wasnâ€™t used before). Here we named it \
**my-1st-regatta-cluster**.

Please note that this document will refer back to the cluster name in later steps. If you decided to use a different cluster name, substitute it as appropriate in the steps throughout the Getting Started Guide.

Select the **Cloud Provider** from the available list and the **Region **from the drop-menu.

Then select the desired **Capacity **from available cluster capacities. For our excersize, please select the **XSMALL** cluster.

Click the **Create Cluster **button to complete the process. In response, you will go back to the **Clusters** screen and your new cluster will appear in the **Starting** status. Please wait until the cluster becomes available. The status will change from **Starting** to **Running**.

You just created your first Regatta cluster. You can start deploying your database. This can be done via multiple ways of connecting to a Regatta cluster. The following steps will use the Regatta Cloud WebCLI. Other methods of connecting to a Regatta cluster will be covered in subsequent sections.
