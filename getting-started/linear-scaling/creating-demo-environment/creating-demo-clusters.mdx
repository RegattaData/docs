title: Creating Demo Clusters
---

Now for the 2 clusters.

The first cluster will be **demo-xsmal** which is the same type of cluster used previously - a single 
node cluster with a single device. The other cluster will be **demo-medium** which is comprised 
of 10 nodes of the same type as **demo-xsmall.** 

To deploy **demo-xsmall,** follow the steps described in Creating a Cluster, select the XSMALL 
cluster type, but this time switch on the **Deploy Demo Data** button as can be seen in the 
screenshot below:

Repeat the same steps for **demo-medium** but this time select the MEDIUM type.
Deploying the clusters will take roughly 10 minutes.

Once completed, each of the clusters will have the three populated tables described in Tables’ 
Schemas. 

Let’s see the number of nodes for each cluster. Just run the following command for each of the 
clusters in its respective CLI:

```SQL
SHOW NODES
```

For each we will see the nodes comprising it.

For **demo-xsmall**

There’s a single node in the cluster.

For **demo-medium:**

<Frame caption="Figure 39 SHOW NODES demo-medium.">

Indeed, there are 10 nodes though you will need to scroll down to see the 10th one).

Both tables in both clusters are now populated with the same data. 20 million rows in each 
table. Performing the following command for each of the tables (namely, Customers and
Purchases) will show that. 

```SQL
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM <table-name>
```

From **demo-xsmall:**

<Frame caption="Figure 40 SELECT COUNT (*) FROM <table-name> for demo-xsmall.">
  <img src="/images/39.png" />
</Frame>

From **demo-medium:**

<Frame caption="Figure 41 SELECT COUNT (*) FROM <table-name> for demo-medium.">
  <img src="/images/40.png" />
</Frame>
