We shall start with the **demo-small** cluster. 

Run the query through the WebCLI and get the result below:

```SQL
| Name         | Item           | Number of Items |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Daisy Clark  | Inline Skates  | 2                |
| Jack Walker  | Soccer Ball    | 3                |
| Kyle Lewis   | Sports Apparel | 1                |
| Ethan Garcia | Track Suit     | 1                |
| Grace Clark  | Snorkel Gear   | 3                |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
5 row(s) returned
```

The query took about 9.4 seconds.

  {" "}

  Note: One should appreciate that the time it takes varies and it depends on some factors, such as the interdependency in the query, the actual network and congestion and more.
