title: "MEDIUM Cluster"
---

Let’s connect to our **demo-medium** cluster. Now perform the same query on the larger cluster. This cluster has 10 nodes and should be around 3⅓ times faster. Let’s run the query again through the CLI.

We get the same result:

```SQL
| Name         | Item           | Number of Items |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Daisy Clark  | Inline Skates  | 2                |
| Jack Walker  | Soccer Ball    | 3                |
| Kyle Lewis   | Sports Apparel | 1                |
| Ethan Garcia | Track Suit     | 1                |
| Grace Clark  | Snorkel Gear   | 3                |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
5 row(s) returned
```

For the larger cluster it took about 2.8 seconds. When comparing with the previous duration of demo-small of roughly 9.4 seconds we can see that the ratio between the two durations is 3⅓ (=3.35) which is 10:3, the ratio between the cluster sizes. The larger cluster executed that same query 3⅓ times faster.

Please note that this is a complex JOIN requires processing a large amount of data. The database must hold a very large amount of intermediate data comprised from all tables to accomplish this task.
