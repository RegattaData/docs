title: MEDIUM Cluster
---

Let’s connect to our **demo-medium** cluster. Now perform the same query on the larger cluster. 
This cluster has 10 nodes and should be around 10 times faster. Let’s run the query again 
through the CLI.

As can be seen above, in the larger cluster it took 2253 msec (around 2.25 seconds). When 
comparing with the previous duration of demo-xsmall of roughly 22.6 seconds we can see that 
indeed the 10 times larger cluster executed that same query roughly 10 times faster.

Please note that this is a complex JOIN requires processing a large amount of data. The 
database must hold a very large amount of intermediate data comprised from all tables to 
accomplish this task.
