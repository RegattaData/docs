title: "MEDIUM Cluster"

Let’s connect to our **demo-medium** cluster. Now perform the same query on the larger cluster.
This cluster has 10 nodes and should be around 10 times faster. Let’s run the query again
through the CLI.

As can be seen above, in the larger cluster it took about 2.8 seconds. When comparing with the previous duration of demo-small of roughly 9.4 seconds we can see that the ratio between the two durations is 3⅓ (=3.35) which is 10:3, the ratio between the cluster sizes. The larger cluster executed that same query 3⅓ times faster.

Please note that this is a complex JOIN requires processing a large amount of data. The database must hold a very large amount of intermediate data comprised from all tables to accomplish this task.
