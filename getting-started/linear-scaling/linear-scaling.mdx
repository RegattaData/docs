title: "Linear Scaling"
---

One of the most exciting features of the Regatta Database is its **Linear Scaling** capability. The performance delivered grows lineraly with the size of the cluster for both OLTP and OLAP.

Following we will demonstarte that on an OLAP query. We will achieve a faster response time proportional to the cluster growth. For that purpose, we will create 2 clusters that will also use the **Deploy Demo Data** option. This is a switch button in the **Create New Cluster** screen. Selecting that will create 2 predefined tables and populate them with predefined data.
