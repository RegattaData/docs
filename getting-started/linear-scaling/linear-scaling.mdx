title: "Linear Scaling"
---

One of the most exciting features of the Regatta Database is its **linear scaling** capability: performance scales linearly with cluster size for both OLTP and OLAP workloads.

Below, we’ll demonstrate this using an OLAP query, showing how response times improve in proportion to cluster growth. To do that, we’ll create two clusters and enable the **Deploy Demo Data** option (a toggle on the **Create New Cluster** screen). Enabling it automatically creates two predefined tables and populates them with sample data.
