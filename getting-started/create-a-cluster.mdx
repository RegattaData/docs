title: Creating a Cluster
---

You may select to use one of the available clusters or create a new one. In this example, we will 
create a new cluster.

The following section describes how to create a new cluster. 

Clicking on the **+ CREATE NEW CLUSTER** button (see Figure 2 Clusters page) will redirect you to the 
**Create New Cluster** screen:

</Frame>



Choose a name for the cluster (one that wasnâ€™t used before). Here we named it **my-1st-regatta-cluster**.

Please note that this document will refer back to the cluster name in later steps. If you decided to use a different cluster name, substitute it as appropriate in the steps throughout the Getting Started Guide.

Select the Provider from the available list and the Region from the drop-menu.

Please note that currently we only offer **Google Cloud Platform** as a Provider and the **us_east** as region.

Then select the **Cluster Type**. Once you click on the field, a drop-down menu will appear offering different cluster sizes (Figure 4). Please select the size required.

In this example we select the **XSMALL** cluster.

Click the **CONFIRM** button to complete the process. In response, you will go back to the **Clusters** screen and your new cluster will appear in the **Starting** status.

Please wait until the cluster becomes available. The status will change from **Starting** to **Running** as seen below (Frame 6).

You just created your first Regatta cluster. You can start deploying your database. This can be done via multiple ways of connecting to a Regatta cluster. The following steps will use the Regatta Cloud user interface CLI. Other methods of connecting to a Regatta cluster will be covered in subsequent sections.
