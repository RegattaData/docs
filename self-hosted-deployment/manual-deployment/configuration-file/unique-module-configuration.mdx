title: "Unique Module Configuration"
---

The second part of the `cluster.config` file is the module-specific section. In this page we will describes this section which is unique for each module in the cluster.

The module-specific section is usually defined at the bottom of the config file.

The section is comprised of 3 parameters: `core_total_ram_budget_for_module_mb` , `ranger_dev_num` ,`core_pdbg_port`

### core_total_ram_budget_for_module_mb

This is the RAM capacity which is dedicated to the module in MB. 

In order to calculate the best value to define in this parameter, we suggest the following recommended guidelines:

1. Get the total RAM available on the server host
2. Subtract 1 GB for the OS usage from the total RAM
3. For the GDD, DCM, Sequencer dedicate at least 500MB each
4. For the RDB dedicate whatever is left on the server.

<Tip>
  For example:\
  In a server/node with 20GB RAM, if there’s only an RDB installed – the RAM budget will be set to 19GB for the RDB module. \
  In a server/node with GDD, Sequencer and DCM, the RAM budget for each is 500MB, and the 17.5GB left will be dedicated to the RDB on that host.
</Tip>

### ranger_dev_num

Leave it set to 1.

### core_pdbg_port

This port number should be unique for each module in the same server/node.
