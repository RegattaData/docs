title: "Main Configuration Top Part"
---

The `cluster.config` file includes 2 sections - the main configuration and the module-specific section. In this page we will describes the main configuration section which is common across the entire cluster.

## System section

Starting at the very top is the description of the entire system.

Following are triplets of NODE parameters, followed by the MODULES’ parameters in that NODE
followed by the DEVICES’ parameters in that node dedicated to the Regatta Cluster.

If there are 3 NODES in the cluster, as can be seen in the example configuration file, then this
trio repeats itself 3 times with the appropriate parameters. If you have more nodes, you will
need to add more trios like that.

For these trios, you will need to apply the following changes:

- system_cluster_id
  a customer unique 32 bit identifier.
  - Each system should have its own unique value.
  - Starting from 1
  - It’s recommended to make it a running number starting at 1.
- system_num_cpus
  - The number of CPUs that in the server that a software module may utilize.
  - This can be set up to the total number of CPUs.

For the rest of the parameters note that the IDs and names are unique across all members of
the clusters. The device LOCAL ID is unique for the server it resides on.

Many parameters can stay as in the example. The server specific parameters should be updated
accordingly. These would be:

- IPs of the server
- Dedicated ports for the modules
- Device parameters
  - Page size
  - Block Size
  - Capacity
  - Path

For the modules’ ports, you may select any number you wish that is not in use. Regatta uses the
following defaults, and we highly recommend keeping them:

- RDB: 8850
- Sequencer: 8841
- GDD: 8842
- DCM: 8843

For the device section:
Each device gets a cluster wide unique number X. All the parameters pertaining to a device in
the configuration file should contain the X in the name (as can be seen below) for ease of use.

- dev_X_module_id

  Same as the rdb module ID it belongs to
- dev_X_name

  There is a recommended nomenclature to follow: Name format mXdY where X is the
  module ID and Y is the device local number
- dev_X_capacity

  The capacity of the device in bytes

See the example below taken from the example in Configuration File.

```java
dev_1_module_id = 10
dev_1_name = m10d1
dev_1_type = SCRATCH
dev_1_local_number = 1
```

If there are more servers, just add additional lines describing that server and modules deployed
on it accordingly in a unique manner.
