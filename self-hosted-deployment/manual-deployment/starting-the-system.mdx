title: "Starting the System"

Once the cluster configuration file is defined, and every module across the cluster has a copy of the `cluster.config` with its module-specific configuration, proceed to start the cluster services.

A `systemd` service is installed with each module RPM package. The service names follow the pattern `regatta-1.0-<module name>`, for example: `regatta-1.0-rdb`.

For a single-node deployment, start all services with the following command:

```bash
systemctl start regatta-*
```

For a multi-node deployment, an additional file should be created for each RDB module named `rdb.config`, alongside the `cluster.config` file:

```bash
/opt/regatta/1.0/rdb/conf/rdb.config
```

The file should contain the ID assigned to the RDB module on the current node, as defined in the configuration file:

```bash
rdb=<module id>
```

For example, if in the configuration file the module ID was defined as follows:

```bash
module_4_id=3
```

Then the `rdb.config` file should contain the following line:

```bash
rdb=3
```

Once the `rdb.config` file is present for each RDB module across the cluster nodes, proceed to start the services on each of the cluster nodes:

```bash
sudo systemctl start regatta-1.0-<module_name>.service
```

Where module is one of the Regatta software modules.

For example:

```bash
sudo systemctl start regatta-1.0-rdb.service
```
