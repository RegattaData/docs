title: "Starting the System"

One the cluster configuration file is defined, and every module across the cluster have a copy of the `cluster.config` with its module-specific configuration, proceed to start the cluster services.

A `systemd` service is installed with each module RPM package. The services names follows the pattern of `regatta-1.0-<module name>` , for example: `regatta-1.0-rdb`

For a single-node deployment, start all the services with a simple command:

```shellscript
systemctl start regatta-*
```

For multi-node deployment, an additional file should be created for each RDB module named **rdb.config** along side the `cluster.config` file:

```sql
/opt/regatta/1.0/rdb/conf/rdb.config
```

The file should contain the ID that was given to the RDB module on the current node, as defined in the configuration file:

```sql
rdb=<module id>
```

For example, if in the configuration file, the module ID was defined as follows:

```sql
module_4_id=3
```

Then the rdb.config file should contain the following line:

```sql
rdb=3
```

Once the `rdb.config` file is also present with each RDB module across the cluster nodes, proceed to start the services on each of the cluster nodes:

```shellscript
systemctl start regatta-*
```
