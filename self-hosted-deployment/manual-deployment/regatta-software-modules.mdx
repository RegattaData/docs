title: "Regatta Software Modules"
---

Regatta has four software modules required to run the Regatta Database. The modules are:

### RDB

The RDB module allows optimal usage of server resources (CPU, network, and I/O). To increase Regatta’s performance and capacity, simply add servers with the RDB module deployed on them.

### Sequencer

The Sequencer module coordinates distributed events among all Regatta components.

### DCM

The Database Catalog Manager (DCM) module manages the database catalog, which contains all schema definitions including tables, materialized views, data types, and hierarchical schema structures.

### GDD

The Global Deadlock Detector (GDD) module is responsible for detecting circular distributed dependencies between transactions in the system and resolving them.

## Modules Distribution

When setting up the Regatta cluster, you will need to determine where each module will reside. Servers that host the RDB module must also assign a storage device for that RDB. Multiple RDB modules can be deployed, while the other modules—DCM, GDD, and Sequencer—should be deployed only once.

The recommended configuration is:

- RDB – on all servers
- GDD, DCM, Sequencer – all on the same server alongside one of the RDBs

Once the distribution of the modules across the servers is decided, install the matching RPM for each module on the servers according to the selected configuration.

The RPMs are located in the deployment package. Save it in a desired directory and extract it. If you received standard Regatta package, the RPMs will be located under:

```bash
./deploy/ansible/roles/regatta.rdb/files
```

Install the RPMs using the following command:

```bash
sudo rpm -i <path/to/regatta_rpm>
```

Where `<path/to/>` is the full or relative path to where the RPM was saved.

<Tip>
  It is possible to use `dnf` or `yum` package managers to install the RPMs. Using package managers will ensure the required dependencies of Regatta are also installed if missing.
