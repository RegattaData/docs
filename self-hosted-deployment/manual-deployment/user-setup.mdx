title: "User Setup"
---

The Regatta cluster requires a dedicated user on each of the servers participating in the cluster. The Regatta user must be defined as follows:

1. Username: `regatta`
2. Permissions: ownership of the block storage devices on the server

The Regatta installation (RPMs) will create a user named `regatta` upon deployment. Deciding which storage devices will be designated for the database does require manual action by the system administrator.

## User creation

If you would like to create the `regatta` user on all servers manually prior to installation, you may do so. In this case, the Regatta RPM will use the Regatta user created by you.

To create a Regatta user with device access, run the following command:

For example:

```shellscript
sudo useradd -m -d /home/regatta -s /bin/bash regatta
```

Verify that the user was created successfully:

```shellscript
getent passwd regatta
```

## Storage permission

A system administrator (or any user with `sudo` permission) will be required to perform the `chown` command on the storage devices dedicated to the Regatta database to grant the `regatta` user read and write access to these drives.

For example:

```shellscript
sudo chown regatta:regatta /dev/<device> # for example: /dev/nvme0n1
```

<Note>
  <u>The devices dedicated to the Regatta database </u>**<u>do not require any filesystem</u>**. Regatta works optimally by utilizing raw devices.
