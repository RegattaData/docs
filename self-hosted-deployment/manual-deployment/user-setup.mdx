title: User Setup
---

Regatta Cluster will require a dedicated user on each of the servers participating in the cluster. 
The Regatta user must be defined as follows:

1. Username: regatta 
2. Permissions: device access permissions on the server 

The RPMs supplied will create the Regatta user upon deployment. You will be required to 
perform the chown command to grant the regatta user access permission to the nodes hard 
drives.

For example:

```javascript
sudo chown regatta:regatta /dev/<device> # for example: /dev/nvme0n1
```

Should you like to create these users on all servers prior to the installation manually, you may do 
so. In this case, the Regatta RPM would use the Regatta user created by you.

To create a Regatta user with device access, please do as described below:

For example:

```javascript
sudo useradd -m -d /home/regatta -s /bin/bash regatta
sudo chown regatta:regatta /dev/<device> # for example: /dev/nvme0n1
```
