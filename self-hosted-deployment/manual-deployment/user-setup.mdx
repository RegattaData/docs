title: "User Setup"
---

Regatta Cluster will require a dedicated user on each of the servers participating in the cluster.
The Regatta user must be defined as follows:

1. Username: regatta
2. Permissions: block storage devices ownership on the server

The RPMs supplied will create the Regatta user upon deployment. Deciding which storage devices will be designated for the database do require a manual action by the system administrator. 

## User creation

Should you like to create these users on all servers prior to the installation manually, you may do
so. In this case, the Regatta RPM would use the Regatta user created by you.

To create a Regatta user with device access, please do as described below:

For example:

```javascript
sudo useradd -m -d /home/regatta -s /bin/bash regatta
```

## Storage permission

A system admin (or any user with `sudo` permission) will be required to perform the `chown` command on the storage devices dedicated for the Regatta database, to grant the regatta user access permission to read and write to these hard drives.

For example:

```javascript
sudo chown regatta:regatta /dev/<device> # for example: /dev/nvme0n1
```

<u>The devices dedicated to the Regatta database do not require any filesystem in place. Regatta implements its own optimized filesystem solution.</u>
