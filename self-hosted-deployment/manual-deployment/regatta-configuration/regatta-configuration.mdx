Regatta has four software modules which are required to run the Regatta Database. The
modules are:

### RDB

The RDB module allows optimal usage of the server resources (CPU, Network and IO). To increase Regattaâ€™s performance and capacity, simply add servers with the RDB module deployed on them.

### Sequencer

The Sequencer module coordinates distributed events between all Regatta components.

### DCM

The Database Catalog Manager (DCM) module manages the database catalog which contains all the schema definitions including tables, materialized views and data types, as well as hierarchical schema structures.

### GDD

The Global Deadlock Detector (GDD) module is responsible for detecting circular distributed dependencies between transactions in the system and resolving them.
