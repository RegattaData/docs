The Regatta Deployment Tool (RDT) helps you automate the process of setting up a RegattaDB cluster.

The RDT can be downloaded from a link provided by Regatta Support. The download will include a `tar` archive containing:

1. The Regatta RPM packages for installing Regatta modules and tools
2. A directory containing the RDT and all its components

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

The RDT will require the following packages on the deployment server (where the RDT is executed):

Linux packages:

- `sshpass`
- `jq`

Python requirements:

- `python3` - version 3.6.8 or above
- `ansible`

These dependencies can be pre-installed manually by the user or left to be installed automatically by the RDT.

<Warning>
  Please note that installing the script dependencies requires an internet connection or having the packages readily available on the server.
</Warning>

### SSH

The RDT utilizes SSH to access all the cluster nodes from the host it is executed on. The SSH connection requires a user with `sudo` permissions to be present on all the cluster nodes. For this document, we will refer to that user as the **deployment_user**.

<Info>
  The `sudo` permission for the deployment user is required for installing the Regatta RPM packages, configuring the required firewall ports, and ensuring proper storage devices permissions for the `regatta` system-user used by the Regatta modules.
