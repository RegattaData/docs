Inside the `Regatta-deploy` directory, you will find a JSON file named `config.json`. The content of the file is as follows:

```json expandable
{
	"regatta": {
		"nodes": [
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.8",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
      			]
  			},
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.9",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
				]
			},
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.10",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

## JSON Breakdown

The `regatta` object contains a `nodes` key whose value is a list of JSON objects.

Each object in the `nodes` list includes two key-value pairs: the node’s internal IP address and a list of dedicated NVMe devices present on that node.

- `internalIp` – The host’s internal IP address used for inter-node communication. This assumes you have an internal network for all nodes in the cluster. If that is not the case, you can put an external IP here instead.
- **`diskPaths`** – A list of objects, each containing a `path` key paired with the absolute path of a storage device on that node.

<Note>
  Each block storage device is defined as a separate JSON object within the `diskPaths` list. The devices can be of any type, not necessarily NVMe.
