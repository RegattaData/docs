Once the prerequisites are met, you can proceed to collect and upload data. The usage for the  command can be shown using the `--help`. Running that will display the following:

```
python3 collect_data.py --help
usage: collect_data.py [-h] [--config_file CONFIG_FILE]
Automate Regatta cluster data collection.
optional arguments:
 -h, --help show this help message and exit
 --config_file CONFIG_FILE Path to 'data_collector_config.json' config file.
```

### Execution

Once the `collect_data` script and the `collect_data_configuration.json` are present on your nodes, you may run the `collect_data` script on each server. The command to run it is:

```shell
python3 collect_data.py --config_file /path/to/collect_data_configuration.json
```

This will execute the collection process based on the parameters in the configuration file.

For example, lets show a run with the defaults:

```shell
python3 collect_data.py –-config_file collect_data_configuration.json
```

The script then will do as follows:

1. Collect all the files from the `deploy_dir` and `logs_dir` directories defined in the configuration json into a compressed archive.

   The archive name have the format:

   `[hostname]-[ip]-[date]-[time].tar.zst`
2. The archive will be stored in the `archive_output_dir` defined in the configuration json.

An example of the compressed archive file:

```shell
/tmp/regatta-host05-172_27_12_2-2024_11_14-15_52_56.tar
```

As we can see in this example, the file name is constructed of the 4 parameters mentioned:

- Server Name: `regatta-host05`
- Internal IP: `172_27_12_2`
- Date: `2024_11_14`
- Time: `15_52_56`

### Uploading Data

If we would like to upload the data collected from the previous command, we would update the following parameters in the `data_collect_configuration.json`:

```json
"upload": true
"tar_path": "/tmp/regatta-host05-172_27_12_2-2024_11_14-15_52_56.tar"
```

This will cause the `data_collect` script to do as follows:

1. **Avoid collecting data **- When tar_path is not null, the data will not be collected from the `deploy_dir` and `logs_dir`paths but rather read from the path in `tar_path`.
2. **Apply the filter **- The data collected from the directory will be filtered according to the templates in `file_ignore_list`.
3. **Upload **- The data will be uploaded to the Regatta cloud storage bucket

Once the data is uploaded, Regatta Support will be able to review and analyze the data.

<Tip>
  If you have internet access when collecting the data, you may set upload to `true` and leave the `tar_path` as `null`. In this case the data will be collected and uploaded to the Regatta cloud bucket in a single run.
