Once you download the collect-data tool, you will notice it has these files:

1. `collect_data.py `– the main script that does the data collection
2. `collect_data_configuration.json` which holds all the configuration parameters
3. `my-company-sa.json` – A service account file to be used to upload the collected data.

### `collect_data_configuration.json`

The configuration file looks as follows:

```json
{
 "regatta_deploy_dir": "/opt/regatta/1.0",
 "regatta_logs_dir": "/var/log/regatta",
 "file_ignore_list": ["cluster.template"],
 "upload_bucket_name": "regatta-customers-uploads",
 "upload_bucket_folder": "my-company",
 "archive_output_dir": "/tmp",
 "service_account_file": "my_company-sa.json",
 "upload": false,
 "delete_tar": false,
 "tar_path": null,
 "folder_path": null
}
```

Most parameters have predefined values which will  be explained later in this page.

The parameters in the json file will determine the way the data will be collected by the collect data script.

As you can see, the first four parameters are separated from the rest. Their default values SHOULD NOT be changed if not approved by Regatta Support and should be regarded as constants. Changing them may break the data collection.

The rest may be configured by you when needed as we describe later. It’s recommended that you consult with Regatta Support prior to changing the default values on the impact that it might have on the data collection to ensure that no data is lost.

#### `regatta_deploy_dir`

This is the location where the Regatta software was deployed in. In this example the default is:

```bash
/opt/regatta/1.0
```

As you can see, it is based on the current version **(1.0)**. This is the location where data related to the configuration of the regatta cluster will be collected from.

#### `regatta_logs_dir`

This is the location where the Regatta cluster stores its logs. The default is:

```bash
/var/log/regatta
```

All available log files will be collected from there.

#### `file_ignore_list`

This list parameter allows you to filter out files that you wish would not be collected by the script. It’s basically a list of patterns that are applied to remove any file that matches it. The default value is:

```bash
cluster.template
```

<Note>
  NOTE: Filtering out files without consulting with Regatta Support prior to doing so may hinder the ability of support to analyze the data and understand the state of the system.
</Note>

#### `upload_bucket_name`

This is the Regatta bucket where we hold the uploaded data. The default is:

```bash
regatta-customers-uploads
```

This should not be changed unless coordinated with Regatta Support.

#### `upload_bucket_folder`

This is your dedicated personal folder in the Regatta bucket. The default value is:

```bash
my-company
```

You should replace it with the folder name you received from Regatta Support.

#### `archive_output_dir`

This is the location where the script will create an archive of all the data collected on the server. The default here is:

```bash
/tmp
```

You can change that default to any preferred directory. Whether changed or left as-is, please make sure that there is sufficient storage available there to hold the local logs. Note that the files collected, in some cases, may be up to several GBs.

#### `service_account_file`

The service account file is the authentication file to the folder. The default is:

```bash
my-company-sa.json
```

You will need to replace this with the name of the service account file you received from Regatta Support.

It is assumed that the file is located in the same place as the `collect_data.py` script. If you decide to locate it elsewhere, please add the path to it as well.

#### `upload`

This flag indicates whether to upload the data or not. The default value is FALSE. In case you have an internet connection accessible, and you would like the script to upload the collected data for you, please change it to TRUE.

<Note>
  Note that you can use the script later to upload the data that was collected and not uploaded yet.
</Note>

#### `delete_tar`

This flag indicates whether to delete the data after a successful upload. The default value is FALSE.

#### `tar_path`

This parameter allows you to upload a tar that was generated but not uploaded as a result of the flag upload being set to FALSE. The default of this flag is NULL. If it is set to a path, for example:

```bash
/tmp/my-tar
```

Then 2 things will happen:

1. The script WILL NOT collect data as it is assumed that the data was collected and it’s in the tar_path. Note that this path should contain a tar.zst file to be uploaded.
2. The collect_data script will try to upload the data to the Regatta cloud storage bucket.

#### `folder_path`

This parameter allows you to request uploading the data located in the `folder_path`. The default value for it is NULL. If it is set to some path, it will collect the files from there instead of the 2 predefined locations, i.e., `regatta_deploy_dir` and `regatta_logs_dir`. It will apply the `file_ignore_list` filter on the data collected from the path defined in `folder_path`.
