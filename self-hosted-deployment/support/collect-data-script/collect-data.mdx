title: "Collecting Data"
---

The `collect_data` script can collect the relevant data from the Regatta cluster for analysis by support. You need to run it on each server. Once it is executed, it will collect the data on that server, pack it in a tar file, compress it and make it available for uploading to the cloud storage bucket. The script may also perform the upload for you if configured accordingly.
