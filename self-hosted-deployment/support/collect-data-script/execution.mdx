Once we have the configuration file set, we can collect and upload data. The usage for the 
command can be shown using the `--help`. Running that will display the following:

```Python
python3 collect_data.py --help
usage: collect_data.py [-h] [--config_file CONFIG_FILE]
Automate Regatta cluster data collection.
optional arguments:
 -h, --help show this help message and exit
 --config_file CONFIG_FILE Path to 'data_collector_config.json' config file.
 ```
Below is a description of the main functions.

### Collecting Data
Once deployed, you may now run the `collect_data` script on each server. The command to 
run it is:

```Python
python3 collect_data.py --config_file /path/to/collect_data_configuration.json
```

This will execute the collection based on the predefined parameters in the configuration file.

For example, lets show a run with the defaults:

```python
python3 collect_data.py â€“config_file collect_data_configuration.json
```

The script then will do as follows:

    1. Collect all the files from the default directories into a compressed archive.

        The archive name have the format:

        `[hostname]-[ip]-[date]-[time].tar.zst`

    2. The archive will be stored in the archive output directory

The file will be stored in the archive directory available for uploading.

An example of the compressed archive file:

```python
tmp/regatta-host05-172_27_12_2-2024_11_14-15_52_56.tar
```

As we can see in this example, the directory is constructed of the 4 parameters mentioned:

    a. Server Name: `regatta-host05`

    b. Internal IP: `172_27_12_2`

    c. Date: `2024_11_14`

    d. Time: `15_52_56`


### Uploading Data

If we would like to upload the data collected from the previous command, we would update the 
following parameters in the `data_collect_configuration.json`:

```json
upload=true
tar_path = "/tmp/regatta-host05-172_27_12_2-2024_11_14-15_52_56.tar"
```

As described previously, this will cause the `data_collect` script to do as follows:

        1. **Avoid collecting data:**

        When tar_path is not null, the data will not be collected from the default paths but 
        rather read from the path in `tar_path`.

        2. **Apply the filter:**

        The data collected from the directory will be filtered according to the templates in 
        `file_ignore_list`.

        3. **Upload**

        The data will be uploaded to the Regatta cloud storage bucket

        <Note> NOTE: We assume that there is active internet connection, otherwise the upload will 
        fail.</Note>

Once the data is uploaded, Regatta Support will be able to review and analyze the data.

<Note> Note that if you have internet access when collecting the data you may set upload to true and 
leave the `tar_path` as `null`. In this case the data will be collected and uploaded to the Regatta 
cloud bucket in a single run.</Note>
