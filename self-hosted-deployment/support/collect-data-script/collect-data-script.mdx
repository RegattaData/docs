The `collect_data` script can collect the relevant data from the Regatta cluster for analysis by 
support. You need to run it on each server. Once it is executed, it will collect the data on that 
server, pack it in a tar file, compress it and make it available for uploading to the cloud storage 
bucket. The script may also perform the upload for you if configured accordingly.
