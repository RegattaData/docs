Regatta offers support for the deployment and running of Regatta clusters. The support may be 
over a video session where the customer grants Regatta Support access to the cluster during 
the session. It may also be offline where data such as logs are collected and shared with 
Regatta for offsite analysis.

To collect the required data and make it available, we supply a script called collect_data. In 
addition, we also supply a storage bucket where the data may be uploaded so Regatta support 
can analyze the collected data.
