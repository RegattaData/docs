title: "Hybrid Deployment"

The following section will describe a way to combine both methods to allow the user to utilize
the script functionality to deploy the system but make desired changes in the configuration
along the way.

The idea here is to break the deployment process into 3 steps:

- [Inventory](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/inventory) - Creating the Regatta Cluster Module distribution
- [Configuration](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/configuration) - Deploying the Regatta Cluster and creating the Distribution
- [Start](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/start) - Starting the system

This will allow the user to stop at each location and make changes if desired.
