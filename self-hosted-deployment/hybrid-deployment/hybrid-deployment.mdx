title: "Hybrid Deployment"
---

The following section describes a method to combine both manual and scripted approaches, allowing the user to utilize script functionality to deploy the Regatta database while making desired changes to the configuration along the way.

This section breaks the deployment process into three steps:

- [Inventory](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/inventory) - Creating the Regatta Cluster Module distribution
- [Configuration](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/configuration) - Deploying the Regatta Cluster and creating the distribution
- [Start](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/start) - Starting the system

Between each deployment step, the user may stop to make modifications to the cluster configuration file if needed and start the cluster when ready.
