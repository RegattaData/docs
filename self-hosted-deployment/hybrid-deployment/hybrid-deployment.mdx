title: "Hybrid Deployment"
---

The following section will describe a way to combine both manual and scripted methods to allow the user to utilize the script functionality to deploy the Regatta database while making desired changes in the configuration along the way.

This section will break the deployment process into 3 steps:

- [Inventory](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/inventory) - Creating the Regatta Cluster Module distribution
- [Configuration](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/configuration) - Deploying the Regatta Cluster and creating the Distribution
- [Start](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/hybrid-deployment/start) - Starting the system

Between each deployment step, the user may stop and make modifications to the cluster configuration file if needed and start the cluster when ready.
