title: Process

The idea here is to break the deployment process into 3 steps:

- Inventory - Creating the Regatta Cluster Module distribution
- Configuration - Deploying the Regatta Cluster and creating the Distribution
- Start - Starting the system

This will allow the user to stop at each location and make changes if desired.
