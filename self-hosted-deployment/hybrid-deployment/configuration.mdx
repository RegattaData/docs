The second step creates all the Regatta configuration files. 

During this step it is possible to edit the `cluster.config` file for any Regatta module and change the module specific parameters such as dedicated RAM capacity etc.

Continue by running:

```
./setup_cluster.sh distribute rpm config
```

- `distribute` flag - copies the RPM packages from the host where the script is executed to each of the cluster nodes/servers
- `rpm` flag - installs the RPM packages on each node/server
- `config` flag - Generates a **cluster.config** file, copy it to each node/server, and append the module-specific section for each module on the cluster

Once done, it is possible to connect to each and any of the cluster nodes/servers via SSH and edit the cluster config file for any module.\
For further detail- follow the steps in the [Configuration File](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/manual-deployment/configuration-file/configuration-file) section and apply the desired changes. 

<Note>
   Note that the script opened the ports that appear in the configuration files for all Regatta
  modules, prior to this stage. So, if you decide to change ports, you also will need to update the
  firewall prior to executing the next step.
