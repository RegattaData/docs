The second step creates all the Regatta configuration files.

During this step, it is possible to edit the `cluster.config` file for any Regatta module and change the module-specific parameters, such as dedicated RAM capacity.

Continue by running:

```
./setup_cluster.sh distribute rpm config
```

- `distribute` command - Copies the RPM packages from the host where the script is executed to each of the cluster nodes/servers.
- `rpm`command -  Installs the RPM packages on each node/server.
- `config`command - Generates a **cluster.config** file, copies it to each node/server, and appends the module-specific section for each module on the cluster.

## Editing Common Cluster Parameters

At this stage, it is also possible to edit the **common** section of the **cluster.config** file.

To do so, edit the **cluster.config** file in the Ansible directory located in the same folder as the deployment script:

```
./ansible/cluster.config
```

Make any changes to the config and save them to the same file.

To update the entire cluster with the changes made to the config file, execute the script with the `update_config` command:

```
./setup_cluster.sh update_config
```

This script will copy the **cluster.config** file to each node/server in the cluster and append the module-specific section for each module.

## Editing Module-Specific Parameters

Once the script execution with either the `config` or `update_config` commands is done, you can connect to any of the cluster nodes/servers via SSH to edit the cluster config file for any module. For further details, follow the steps in the [Configuration File](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/manual-deployment/configuration-file) section and apply the desired changes.

<Note>
  Note that the script has opened the ports that appear in the configuration files for all Regatta modules prior to this stage. If you decide to change ports, you will also need to update the firewall before executing the next step.
