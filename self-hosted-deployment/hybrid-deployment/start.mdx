Lastly, starting the cluster using the script can be done by running:

```
./setup_cluster.sh service
```

This will execute the steps which start the Regatta services across the cluster.

At this stage the cluster is up and ready.

It is also possible to stop and start the cluster as individual steps by using the `stop_cluster` and `start_cluster` flags.

```
./setup_cluster.sh stop_cluster
./setup_cluster.sh start_cluster
```
