title: "Setup Cluster"
---

In the directory where the `config.json` file resides, you will find a script named `setup_cluster.sh` which is the script that performs the automatic deployment of Regatta (as described in the [scripted-solution](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/scripted-solution/scripted-solution) page)

Switch user to the `deployment_user` mentioned in the previous pages and run the `setup_cluster.sh` to continue with the automatic deployment.

```
./setup_cluster.sh
```

You will be asked to accept the Regatta End-User-License-Agreement (EULA) located in our
website at https://regatta.dev/eula/. This will appear as follows:

```
By using this script and deploying the Regatta Cluster you agree to the EULA located at:
https://regatta.dev/eula/
Please read the EULA and accept the terms.
Do you accept the terms of the EULA? [Y/n]
```

In case you need time to read or for any other reason, entering `n` will abort the script with the
message:

```
EULA not accepted - deployment aborted...
```

You can always restart the deployment using the script.

By entering `Y` you confirm that you read and accepted the EULA. The deployment will continue.

Next, the script will prompt the user for inputing the path to the SSH key and the username that can be used to connect to the cluster nodes.

```
Enter path to SSH key: /<path>/<ssh_key_file>
```

```
Enter username to use with ssh key: deployment_user
```

The script will validate that SSH connection is working on each node defined in the `config.json` file. Once all connections validated, the script will  enquire whether the `deployment_user` needs password for sudo operations:

```
Does the <deployment_user> requires a password to run sudo commands? [Y/n]: 
```

If the reply is yes, you will need to enter the password when asked later with the following prompt:

```
BECOME PASS:
```

<Note>
  **The password will stay in volatile memory and is never stored**.

<Warning>
  Please note that during the script execution, the script will install the RPM packages provided in the same download link. These RPM packages will check for the Regatta dependencies described in the [Prerequisites](https://docs.regatta.dev/self-hosted-deployment/prerequisites) section. If the packages are missing on the cluster nodes and there is no internet access to download them, the deployment will stop at this stage.
