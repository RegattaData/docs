title: Setup
---

To run the script, we would also need a user on all servers. For this document, we will refer to 
that user as the **deployment_user**. 

The **deployment_user** will be used for 2 purposes:
1. To run the deployment script from one of the servers
2. To run local deployment on each of the servers

The **deployment_user** should have sudo permissions. We would also require all servers to use 
the same SSH keys to access them with the **deployment_user**.

In addition, as part of the setup, the script requires the following packages on the deployment 
server (where the script is executed):

- **python3** - prerequisite for Ansible 
- **sshpass** - allows for scripted ssh connection with password
- **jq** â€“ for parsing json files
- **ansible** - provisioning automation tool used for the cluster setup itself

These dependencies are installed automatically by the script. Please note that this requires an 
internet connection or having the packages readily available on the server.

Login to one of the servers that will participate in the cluster using the **deployment_user**, copy 
the downloaded tar file to it, and open it.
