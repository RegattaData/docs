title: Config.json

In the scripted solution folder you will see a JSON file, namely **config.json**, which can be seen 
below.

```json
{
    "regatta": {
    "nodes": [
    {
    "internalIp": "10.208.0.8",
    "diskPaths": [
    {
    "path": "/dev/sdb"
       }
      ] 
  },
  {
    "internalIp": "10.208.0.9",
    "diskPaths": [
    {
    "path": "/dev/sdb"
       }
     ]  
   },
  {
    "internalIp": "10.208.0.10",
    "diskPaths": [
    {
    "path": "/dev/sdb"
          }
        ]
       }
      ]
     }
}
```

You will need to edit it according to the cluster on which Regatta will be deployed. For each 
server, add a record holding the IP of that server followed by all the devices on that server that 
will be dedicated to Regatta.

Add more entries if you have more nodes.
