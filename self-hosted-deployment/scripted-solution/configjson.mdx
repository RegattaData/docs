title: "Config.json"

Downloading the Regatta tar archive can be done directly on one of the cluster nodes (using `wget` or a similar tool) or on an external host and then copied to one of the cluster nodes.

The tar archive includes the RPM packages and the Regatta deployment tool.

Extract the archive:

```shellscript
tar -zxf Regatta-X.X.X.X.tar.gz
```

After extracting the archive, a directory named **Regatta-deploy** will be created in the location where the `tar` command was executed.

Inside the **Regatta-deploy** directory, you will find a JSON file named **config.json**. The content of the file is as follows:

```json expandable
{
	"regatta": {
		"nodes": [
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.8",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
      			]
  			},
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.9",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
				]
			},
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.10",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

## JSON Breakdown

The `regatta` object contains a `nodes` key whose value is a list of JSON objects.

Each object in the `nodes` list includes two key-value pairs: the node’s internal IP address and a list of dedicated NVMe devices present on that node.

- **`internalIp`** – The host’s internal IP address used for inter-node communication.
- **`diskPaths`** – A list of objects, each containing a `path` key paired with the absolute path of a storage device on that node.

<Note>
  Each block storage device is defined as a separate JSON object within the `diskPaths` list.

  The devices can be of any type, not necessarily NVMe.
</Note>

After editing the `config.json` file, proceed to the next page to execute the deployment tool.
