Downloading the Regatta tar archive can be done directly on one of the cluster nodes (via `wget` or similar tool) OR downloaded on external host and copied to one of the cluster nodes.

The tar archive includes the RPM packages and deployment script.

Extract the tar:

```shellscript
 tar -zxf Regatta-X.X.X.X.tar.gz
```

After extracting the tar, you will find a directory named **Regatta-deploy** in the filesystem path where the `tar` command was executed.

In the \*\*Regatta-deploy \*\*folder, you will find a JSON file named **config.json**. The content of the file is as follows:

```json expandable
{
	"regatta": {
		"nodes": [
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.8",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
      			]
  			},
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.9",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
				]
			},
			{
				"internalIp": "10.208.0.10",
				"diskPaths": [
					{"path": "/dev/nvme0n1"},
					{"path": "/dev/nvme1n1"}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

## JSON breakdown

The regatta object contains a `nodes` key which value is a list of JSON objects.

Each object in the nodes list includes 2 key-value pairs of the node's IP address and dedicated NVMe devices list present on that node.

- "`internalIp`" - The value is the host's internal IP used for inter-node communication
- "`diskPaths`" - The value is a list of key-values, which each item key is `path` and value is the absolute path of the NVMe device on that node.

<Note>
  Note that each NVMe device is defined as a single JSON object inside the list of `diskPaths`
