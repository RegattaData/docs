title: Scripted Solution
---

Regatta also offers a scripted solution that will set up the Regatta cluster for you based on 
minimal input. The script follows the same method described in the manual process and 
applies the recommendations. For example, it will dedicate RAM to the different modules as 
much as possible (see core_total_ram_budget_for_module_mb for details).

The script can be downloaded from a link that will be supplied from Regatta Support. The 
download will include a tar ball containing:

1. The RPM modules (as described above)
2. A folder holding the scripted solution with all its components

Once downloaded, follow these steps.
